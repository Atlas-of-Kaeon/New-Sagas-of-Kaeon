			The Citadel of Yggdrasil may refer either to a single metaphorical celestial citadel
			where soaring Aces would convene, reside, and travel with, or to a network of them.

			Their forms would be modeled after a large tree to represent their connection to
			Yggdrasil of A-O.

			They are said to have access to the Kaeon META.
