			Chapter 1 - The Peace
		-
			-
				Chapter 1 - The Peace: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child and the traveler lived in peace for a time.
				-
		-
			Chapter 2 - The Test
		-
			-
				Chapter 2 - The Test: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And the child grew and thrived in the home of the traveler, and learned of many
					amazing arts.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - The Test: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Now the traveler noticed that among all the arts, it was the great art that the
					child possesed a particular affinity for.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - The Test: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Indeed, the great art was common to the elite among the people in those latter
					days, for it was an elemental fixture of their literacy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - The Test: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Yet the traveler saw fit that the child should possess a more profound
					reverence for that by which man may command matter, that by which man may play
					God.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - The Test: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Thus when the child had come upon a decade did the traveler, upon waking from a
					visit unto their past upon the road of dreams, take the child before the waters
					of the forest so as to give unto them a trial befitting of the great art.
				-
			-
				Chapter 2 - The Test: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And in the depths of the forest did the traveler capsize their vessel and cast
					it into a pit.
				-
		-
			Chapter 3 - The Problem
		-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Problem: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child had a penchant for mischief, and lay turned down in the waters to
					the horror of the traveler, only then to jump up to their amusement and the
					traveler's annoyance.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Problem: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Yet only upon rising from the water did they see that the traveler had forsaken
					their vessel, and they cried out, and they protested unto the traveler "will
					you not fetch the vessel, as I am too weak to do myself, for how else shall we
					return home?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Problem: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the traveler said unto the child "see that you are a human among the
					elements, thus you need not to possess great strength of body, for you shall
					take control over the strength of nature so as to acquire the means by which we
					may depart."
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Problem: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Knowing any further protest was in vain did the child take heed of the
					traveler's words, and took note of the locale.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Problem: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the child waded in the waters, and saw that the waters parted upon their
					body, and parted also upon the stones they stood upon.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Problem: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Thus the child began to build a fort from the stones upon the river bed, and
					behold, as the waters parted upon the fort did they flow unto the pit.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Problem: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Yet the vessel would not rise, for the earth of the pit swallowed up the
					waters.
				-
			-
				Chapter 3 - The Problem: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And in despair did the child slump against the dirt in defeat, and weep.
				-
		-
			Chapter 4 - The Solution
		-
			-
				Chapter 4 - The Solution: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the traveler said unto the child, "see that you have indeed taken nature's
					strength for your own, and see that you have learned that nature is a devious
					and fickle beast, but know this, neither your tears nor anyone else's shall
					fill this pit nor heal any wound".
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - The Solution: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the traveler wiped the tears from the child's eye and said unto them
					"therefore, do not dare to give up".
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - The Solution: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And with their eyes dry did the child rise again, and stood for a moment in
					thought.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - The Solution: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child retrieved yet more stones from the riverbed, and placed them unto
					the floor of the pit.
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - The Solution: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Behold, the waters held their place, and the vessel rose!
				-
			-
				Chapter 4 - The Solution: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Thus did the child pass the trial, and the traveler said unto them, "now
					reflect upon this day, and know from this day forth that no matter how dire the
					situation there shall always be a way up."
				-
		-
			Chapter 5 - The Knowledge
		-
			-
				Chapter 5 - The Knowledge: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now in the days following their departure from the forest and unto their home
					did the traveler teach the child further regarding the great art, and the child
					became strong in it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5 - The Knowledge: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And beyond the sight of the traveler did the child return unto the forest many
					times so as to reflect further upon the great art.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5 - The Knowledge: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And by the time two suns had come and gone since the child had passed the trial
					did they become so strong in the great art that they employed its might to
					forge for themselves a third eye.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5 - The Knowledge: Verse 4
			-
				-
					However, beyond the horizon the tyrant made war with an uprising led by the
					prophet.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5 - The Knowledge: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And having seen the power of meta as their forces fled the freedom fighters,
					the tyrant knew that the traveler might know its secrets also, and so conspired
					to come against the traveler for the sake of an invincible weapon, and directed
					their wrath to do what they would with the village.
				-
			-
				Chapter 5 - The Knowledge: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Meanwhile, the child, having grown strong in the arts, took of the humble funds
					raised with them to allot for themselves a platform upon which to perform, and
					to commision their favorite sweets shop to cater the audience, so that, on the
					next anniversary of the traveller's birth, they would present a display of
					their learnings unto the people of the village, as a surpise gift of gratitude
					unto their teacher. 
				-
			-
				Chapter 5 - The Knowledge: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And for the coming performance did the child begin to weave a narrative in
					which to contextualize it, working in mirrors of all that they knew and all
					whom they knew.
				-
		-
			Chapter 6 - The Cry
		-
			-
				Chapter 6 - The Cry: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child was pure of heart, innocent, and ignorant of the wicked truth of
					life, knowing not the law of this world, to kill or be killed, for the strong
					eat the weak.
				-
			-
				Chapter 6 - The Cry: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And as the child reflected upon the great art did they play together with the
					creatures of the forest.
				-
			-
				Chapter 6 - The Cry: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And one day did the child deliver a small creature struggling in the waters of
					the river unto its bank.
				-
			-
				Chapter 6 - The Cry: Verse 4
			-
				-
					BUT BEFORE THE CHILD'S EYES, THE VERY CREATURE UNTO WHOM THE CHILD HAD GIVEN
					NEW LIFE, SNUFFED OUT THE LIFE OF ANOTHER UPON THE BANK, AND THE CHILD KNEW THE
					LAW AND ITS INIQUITY FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND THEY CRIED OUT IN HORROR.
				-
		-
			Chapter 7 - The Love
		-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now in the days following the child's cry did they seek console from the
					traveler.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the traveler inquired if the child had loved this creature who had perished
					before them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now the child stood perplexed, for it was their understanding that this word
					"love" referred to an erotic sort of passion, not the sort of thing that one,
					save for a deviant, might have towards a beast.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the traveler said that one who would say that physical passion is not
					merely one of many expressions of love, but is love itself, is spiritually
					bankrupt.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the traveler recited a story in the book of the old God from three thousand
					suns ago, of how the child of God performed the greatest act of love ever
					known, not an act of lustful passion that lasted a single night, but an act of
					self sacrifice that echoed across all of time.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now the child stood amazed before the nobility of the child of God, and
					expressed a desire to emulate such generosity unto all.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the traveler said that if the child truly loves this world, then they
					should not die, but should live, and express their love unto its people in
					life.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Now the traveler asked if the child truly understood love, and the child was
					unsure.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And so the traveler, who had forged the child by their hand as the old God was
					said to have done unto the children of the garden, yet loved this child such
					that no sin could ever sever or revoke it, lifted the child into a heartfelt
					embrace, and the traveler repeated their question, and the child understood.
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 10
			-
				-
					"Indeed", said the traveler, "love is the greatest force in the universe."
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 11
			-
				-
					"And...", said the traveler, "it is by the love that you have for this world
					that you shall be a light unto it, in this my faith is absolute."
				-
			-
				Chapter 7 - The Love: Verse 12
			-
				-
					And so the traveler and the child went unto the table so as to bring that night
					to a close.
				-
		-
			Chapter 8 - The Visit
		-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now As the child and the traveler sat before the table was their door visted by
					a strange figure, who, though an elder of the child, appeared as a mirror image
					unto them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the traveler recoiled in horror, for they knew the strange figure's
					identity, but as this figure had recited the traveler's name did the child
					welcome them into their home, for any friend of the traveler was a friend of
					the child, and the child went to retrieve a gift for their guest.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now while the child was away did the traveler confront the strange figure,
					pleading for the child not to know the terror of this world.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Yet the strange figure had fated the child to leave, and the traveler protested
					to no avail, for they knew this strange figure's decision was absolute.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Now the child returned unto the table bearing their gift, and the strange
					figure ate of it, and remarked that its sweetness emulated that of the child, a
					remark the child found flattering yet odd.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the strange figure asked of the traveler if they had meant what they said,
					that love was the greatest force in the unvierse, and the traveler froze in
					fear of the eavesdropper.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the strange figure said unto the child and the traveler: "surely, as you
					are aware that love can motivate good and evil alike, it is not the greatest
					force in the unvierse, for that title belongs only to that which sits at the
					core of God's heart, the way up, whatever that might happen to be, beacuse that
					is what love ultimately answers to."
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And seeing fit now to depart did the strange figure place their hand upon the
					child so as to bid them farewell.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 9
			-
				-
					BUT IN A FIT OF RAGE, THE TRAVELER STRUCK THE STRANGE FIGURE OFF THEIR FEET,
					AND THE HOUSE SHOOK AS THE STRANGE FIGURE COLLIDED WITH AND SEARED THE FLOOR,
					AND THE CHILD CRIED OUT IN SHOCK.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 10
			-
				-
					So, the strange figure acknowledged that they had overstayed their welcome, and
					went at last to depart, but as they stood before the door did they say unto the
					child: "know this little one, the world, your future, is filled with twists and
					turns, ups and downs, hopes and dreams, death and despair, but there is one
					thing you must remember, no matter what happens."
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 11
			-
				-
					And the child paused, and the strange figure said unto them: "remember that you
					are good, my child, always remember this."
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 12
			-
				-
					And the strange figure left with that, and after the door had closed did the
					child look through the window only to see that the strange figure had vanished.
				-
			-
				Chapter 8 - The Visit: Verse 13
			-
				-
					AND IN A VIOLENT FIT DID THE TRAVELER CURSE EVERYTHING IN SIGHT, AND THE CHILD
					FLED UNTO THEIR QUARTERS, AND THE TRAVELER WEPT FOR THE CHILD.
				-
		-
			Chapter 9 - The Alert
		-
			-
				Chapter 9 - The Alert: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the traveler knew that tragedy approached, but knew neither when nor how,
					until upon the next anniversary of their birth, the very day the child was to
					perform their arts in the traveller's name, the traveller heard upon a wave of
					light that the wrath of the tyrant descending upon the village.
				-
			-
				Chapter 9 - The Alert: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Thus did the traveler, after arming themselves, with both conventional and
					unconventional agents, go to fetch the child, but could not locate them, and
					the traveler ran from their home, desperately calling the child's name.
				-
			-
				Chapter 9 - The Alert: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now as it happened the child, having kept their plans hidden from the traveller
					that the day might not be spoiled, sent their friends to fetch the guest of
					honor, but as the two searches met did the traveler make known their distress,
					demanding to know where the child was.
				-
			-
				Chapter 9 - The Alert: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the children, noting the expression upon the traveler's face, pointed in
					the direction of the market square, and the traveler ran off, but as they
					darted past the children, they turned for a brief moment to face them, knowing
					what was to be their fate, and they whispered "I am... so sorry...".
				-
		-
			Chapter 10 - The Performance
		-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the traveler entered what appeared to be a vacant area in the center of the
					village, only to be met with thunderous applause from the townsfolk, and the
					child, taking that as their cue, ascended to the stage.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the traveler, seeing the child, called out to them, and the child,
					surrounded by great creations of their own design, responded in a grandiose
					tone so as to greet their guest of honor, but their smile began to fade as the
					traveler charged towards the stage, violently shoving audience members to the
					ground in the process.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And as the traveler lept onto the stage was the child taken aback as the
					traveler towered over them, and the child, shaken but hoping that it was merely
					a misunderstanding, said nervously unto their guest "this... this is... for
					you...".
				-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now the traveler, snapping out of their terror for just long enough to realize
					what this all was, did acknowledge that it was an impressive display, but
					immediately reverted to a stern tone, insisting that the child must leave with
					them at once.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 5
			-
				-
					But the child protested, demanding to know where they were going and why it was
					so important that the traveler had to spit their gift in their face, but the
					traveler, to avoid throwing the entire crowd into a panic, refused to say.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now as they child continue to protest did the traveler seize them by the hand,
					before dragging them kicking and screaming off the stage.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 7
			-
				-
					NOW AS THE CHILD'S HOPE FOR THIS DAY GAVE WAY TO A WELL OF TEARS DID THEY, IN
					THEIR MISERY, CRY UNTO THE TRAVELER "I HATE YOU!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And the traveler paused together with the whole of the crowd in shock, and
					though they struggled to keep their composure, they began to cry, and as they
					turned to face the child did the child, caught off guard by their own tone,
					saying "I... I did not mean..."
				-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 9
			-
				-
					But as the child stuttered their apology did the traveler take note of an
					unusual hue reflecting off the child's face, and of the fact that something in
					the sky had caught the child's attention.
				-
			-
				Chapter 10 - The Performance: Verse 10
			-
				-
					And the child, awestruck, asked "what... is that?"
				-
		-
			Chapter 11 - The Terror
		-
			-
				Chapter 11 - The Terror: Verse 1
			-
				-
					NOW AS THE SKY GREW BRIGHTER DID THE TRAVELER, IN A PANIC, TACKLE THE CHILD TO
					THE GROUND SO AS TO SHIELD THE CHILD WITH THEIR BODY, AS THE SKY LIT UP IN A
					BRILLIANT FLASH, AND THE EARTH SHOOK.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11 - The Terror: Verse 2
			-
				-
					AND THE CHILD STRUGGLED UNDER THE TRAVELER'S WEIGHT, BEFORE THE TRAVELER
					PAINSTAKINGLY LIFTED THEMSELVES UP TO REVEAL THAT THEY WERE BLEEDING, AND THE
					CHILD AND THE TRAVELER LOOKED AROUND TO SEE THAT THE MARKET SQUARE HAD BEEN
					LAID TO WASTE, THE PEOPLE ALL EITHER DEAD OR INJURED.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11 - The Terror: Verse 3
			-
				-
					AND AS THE CHILD ATTEMPTED TO SCREAM DID THE TRAVELER MUFFLE THEM BEFORE DIVING
					WITH THE CHILD INTO AN ALLEY AND DRAWING THEIR WEAPON, AND AS THEY TOOK COVER
					WAS THE MARKET SQUARE SWARMED BY THE WRATH OF THE TYRANT.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11 - The Terror: Verse 4
			-
				-
					NOW THE TRAVELER HELD THE CHILD CLOSE AS THEY SNUCK THROUGH THE ALLEY TOWARDS A
					SEWER LINE, THAT THEY MIGHT MAKE THEIR ESCAPE, BUT JUST AS THEY NEARED THE
					ENTRANCE WAS THE PATH OBSTRUCTED BY A SOLDIER.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11 - The Terror: Verse 5
			-
				-
					AND THE TRAVELER SET THE CHILD ON THE GROUND, BEHIND A SMALL PILLAR, THAT THEY
					MIGHT NOT BEAR WITNESS TO WHAT THE TRAVELER WAS ABOUT TO DO, BUT THE CHILD, IN
					THEIR NAIVETE, DEFIED THE TRAVELER ONCE MORE AND SAW AS THE TRAVELER SHOT DEAD
					THE SOLDIER WHO STOOD IN THEIR PATH.
				-
			-
				Chapter 11 - The Terror: Verse 6
			-
				-
					BUT BEFORE THE CHILD COULD AIR THEIR GRIEF DID THE TRAVELER SEIZE THEM ONCE
					MORE BEFORE SPRINTING SWIFTLY INTO THE PIPES.
				-
		-
			Chapter 12 - The Run
		-
			-
				Chapter 12 - The Run: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now once the traveler had run at least one thousand paces into the depths of
					the sludge did they permit themselves to rest for a moment, and they removed
					their hand from the child's mouth.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12 - The Run: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And now free to air their grief through the vile stench did the child cry out,
					throwing themselves unto the traveler for comfort, mourning their friends and
					demanding an explanation.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12 - The Run: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the traveler, struggling to find the words to comfort the child in their
					grief, let alone to air their own, was cut short as the ground above shook once
					more, and the traveler took the child upon their shoulder again, insisting that
					an explanation could wait.
				-
			-
				Chapter 12 - The Run: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the traveler was clever, and the traveler was swift, and they made their
					way through the pipes with a cunning befitting of their genius.
				-
		-
			Chapter 13 - The Hunter
		-
			-
				Chapter 13 - The Hunter: Verse 1
			-
				-
					But neither clever nor swift enough to elude the wrath of the tyrant, and so
					the traveler and the child were confronted by a hunter of the tyrant's wrath as
					they emerged from underground, whom as it happened had once been a bitter rival
					of the traveler while in the empire's service.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - The Hunter: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the hunter, reveling in their newfound power over the traveler's fate,
					declared at gunpoint that the traveler was to surrender and be brought before
					the tyrant, who might yet show mercy if unopposed.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - The Hunter: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But the traveler knew what would befall the world if the tyrant learned the
					nature of meta, and so feigned surrender, only to then strike the hunter in the
					back.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - The Hunter: Verse 4
			-
				-
					AND THE TRAVELER FOUGHT VALLIANTLY, BUT THEIR STRENGTH FAILED THEM IN OLD AGE,
					AND THEY FELL UPON THE GROUND AS THE HUNTER MORTALLY WOUNDED THEM WITH THE
					FRUITS OF THE TRAVELER'S OWN ARTS, AND THE CHILD CRIED OUT FOR THEM.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - The Hunter: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Now the hunter, realizing that they could not return unto the tyrant empty
					handed, took note of the child, and seized the child by the hand as they went
					to inform their commander of this turn of events.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - The Hunter: Verse 6
			-
				-
					But as the hunter relayed their report did the child, enraged, and ignorant of
					the true power of the traveler's more unconventional weapon, draw it from the
					sack on their hip, and with it, fired upon the hunter.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - The Hunter: Verse 7
			-
				-
					But it seemed, despite the sudden flash that there was no effect, and the
					hunter, shocked, seized the weapon and cast it away.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - The Hunter: Verse 8
			-
				-
					BUT WITH THE FORCE OF THE THROW DID THE HUNTER'S HAND FLY AWAY WITH THE WEAPON.
				-
			-
				Chapter 13 - The Hunter: Verse 9
			-
				-
					AND THEN DID THE CHILD RECOIL IN HORROR AS THE VIOLENT CRY OF THE HUNTER FOR
					MERCY DISSOLVED TOGETHER WITH THEIR BODY, AND THE EARTH BELOW BECAME RED AS
					BLOOD AND BONE MELTED THROUGH THE GAPS IN THE CHILD'S FINGERS.
				-
		-
			Chapter 14 - The Death
		-
			-
				Chapter 14 - The Death: Verse 1
			-
				-
					But beyond the child's guilt was agony over the traveler's injury, and the
					child pleaded in vain for the traveler to stay.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14 - The Death: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Yet the traveler, sensing the approah of their end, pleaded with the child to
					avoid any contact with the figure who had visited them in their home, for in
					that figure's path lay nothing but destruction.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14 - The Death: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the traveler, in their dying breaths, commanded the child to flee past the
					horizon.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14 - The Death: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But the child would not listen, and so, despite their small stature, flung the
					traveler's weakened torso over their shoulder, and attempted to deliver their
					guardian from death.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14 - The Death: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the traveler pleaded for the child to run, but the child was stubborn, and
					refused to let the traveler go gently into that good night.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14 - The Death: Verse 6
			-
				-
					BUT AFTER DRAGGING ONE EASILY TWICE THEIR SIZE FOR NO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED
					PACES DID THE CHILD'S STRENGTH FAIL THEM, AND AS THE CHILD FELL INTO THE DIRT
					DID THEY HEAR THE TRAVELER FALL INTO THE VOID AS THEIR HEART STOPPED.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14 - The Death: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the child rolled over the traveler's empty corpse to see the tears they
					left behind, which mixed with the tears of the child as the child wept.
				-
			-
				Chapter 14 - The Death: Verse 8
			-
				-
					So, thoughout the next hour did the child stay with the traveler, cycling from
					denial to depression, but they could not find the resolve to accept what had
					happened.
				-
		-
			Chapter 15 - The Escape
		-
			-
				Chapter 15 - The Escape: Verse 1
			-
				-
					BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN WAS THE CHILD THROWN BACK BY THE FORCE OF A BULLET, WHICH
					SEVERED THE TRAVELER'S HEAD WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT LANDED IN THE CHILD'S LAP.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15 - The Escape: Verse 2
			-
				-
					AND THE CHILD LOOKED UP TO SEE TWO MORE SCOUTS TAKING AIM UPON THEM, THUS DID
					THE CHILD RUN AWAY, TRIPPING OVER THEMSELVES AS THE STRUGGLED TO GET UP.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15 - The Escape: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But though another bullet would have been their end, one of the scouts insisted
					that the child should be taken alive, thus did the scouts pursue the child on
					foot.
				-
			-
				Chapter 15 - The Escape: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now the scouts, in their superior condition, close the gap in distance fast,
					but the child, remembering the forest they had played and learned so much in,
					ran into the woods and past the scout's line of sight, and came upon the river

				Chapter 15 - The Escape: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the child seized a piece of driftwood from upon the shore, and rode it over
					a shallow waterfall, behind which lay a small grotto, and the child cowered
					inside of it.
				-
		-
			Chapter 16 - KIPAN
		-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now in time the wrath of the tyrant came upon the river, and followed it
					downstream, just past the waterfall.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 2
			-
				-
					BUT STILL TRAUMATIZED BY THE EVENTS OF THAT AWFUL DAY DID THE CHILD LET OUT A
					SMALL WHIMPER UPON SEEING THEIR ASSAILANTS, AND ONE OF THE SCOUTS IMMEDIATELY
					TURNED AROUND AND FIRED UPON THE GROTTO, ALMOST HITTING THE CHILD, WHO FELL
					SILENT.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But not being able to see the presence of the grotto did the wrath of the
					tyrant believe it had been an illusion, thus did they continue on their way.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And so, as night fell did the child finally let out the tears they had been
					holding in, and cried themselves to sleep.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 5
			-
				-
					BUT THOUGH THE CHILD SOUGHT COMFORT FROM THE TRAVELER IN THEIR DREAM, THEY WERE
					INSTEAD MET BY THE WRATH OF A SPECTRE IN THE IMAGE OF THE TRAVELER'S GHOST, AND
					THE WATERS OF THE WOODS RAN UPSTREAM IN TERROR AS THE CHILD WAS SEIZED BY THEIR
					THROAT.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the child awoke in a fright, but upon waking up did they find that a kind
					creature had come unto their lap, seeking refuge from a terror of its own, and
					the child would remember this creature, for they had found console in it, thus
					did they name it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And in the morning did the child look for something to feed the kind creature,
					and themselves, and climbed up a tree to fetch the fruit from it, but was
					dissapointed to find it lacking compared to the produce the traveler had
					brought them before.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And the child fed the kind creature, even at the expense of their own hunger,
					for the child was kind in nature.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Now as the days passed did the child seek refuge from the moon each night, for
					in the absence of the traveler were they afraid of the dark, yet the proceeded
					in the direction opposite the village, as the traveler had instructed them to
					do.
				-
			-
				Chapter 16 - KIPAN: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Pity unto the child, who continued to wander in the wilderness, for many days
					and many nights, as their vitality faded, with only the company of the kind
					creature to lift their spirits.

			Chapter 17 - The Camp Town
		-
			-
				Chapter 17 - The Camp Town: Verse 1
			-
				-
					At long last, after many trials, a mountain, and a moon did the child come upon
					the camp town.
				-
			-
				Chapter 17 - The Camp Town: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the camp town was vile and depraved, from one end to the other, from
					sunrise to sunset, for the wrath of the tyrant had sapped the goodwill from it
					with the jewels they stole.
				-
			-
				Chapter 17 - The Camp Town: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Yet in their naivete did the child cry for help unto the people of the town.
				-
			-
				Chapter 17 - The Camp Town: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And some merchants heard the child, and came to them, and offered refuge, but
					demanded that the child release the kind creature into the woods, for they
					could not accomany a beast.
				-
			-
				Chapter 17 - The Camp Town: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the child hesitated, but eventually returned the kind creature unto its
					place among the forest, and bid it farewell.
				-
			-
				Chapter 17 - The Camp Town: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Thus did the child accompany the merchants unto their abode, depressed in the
					absence of their animal friend, and turned around, just in time to see the kind
					creature running after them and crying out, before disappearing from sight
					amongst the crowd, but the merchants refused to let the child go back.
				-
		-
			Chapter 18 - The Merchants
		-
			-
				Chapter 18 - The Merchants: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child, upon the consoling of the merchants, eventually came to accept
					that they had no other choice, and that night were they given bread and
					vegetable soup for supper, but from a distance did the merchants appear to
					inspect the child as they ate.
				-
			-
				Chapter 18 - The Merchants: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the merchants led the child to bed, and the child looked out through the
					window, and pondered over the traveler.
				-
			-
				Chapter 18 - The Merchants: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And lulled into a sense of safety by the tranquil sky did the child fall
					asleep.
				-
			-
				Chapter 18 - The Merchants: Verse 4
			-
				-
					NOW THE CHILD AWOKE TO FIND THEMSELVES BOUND AND SHACKLED, FOR THE MERCHANTS
					CONSPIRED TO BARGAIN THEM AS CHATTEL FOR LABORS OF MANY SORTS.
				-
			-
				Chapter 18 - The Merchants: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Now did the child see, the world for what it was, in all its iniquity.
				-
			-
				Chapter 18 - The Merchants: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the child, held in bondage before the merchants, cried to no avail, and was
					beaten for their tears, and mocked for having been so naive and gullible.
				-
			-
				Chapter 18 - The Merchants: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the child was sold unto a master for thirty silver jewels.
				-
		-
			Chapter 19 - The Servitude
		-
			-
				Chapter 19 - The Servitude: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child was taken unto the master's home, well furnished for one in such
					a place as the camp town.
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - The Servitude: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And as the third eye had made known the child's arts, the master permitted the
					child to retain it, and set the child to sophisticated work.
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - The Servitude: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the other slaves of the master had envy unto the child for the favor they
					had been granted, and the master thought themselves gracious unto the child.
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - The Servitude: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now after a moon's length of service did the master call upon the child to
					pleasure them, for despite the child's youth did the master find them fair to
					look upon, and the other slaves mocked the child, who in their innocence
					understood not the master's intentions.
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - The Servitude: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And within the master's quarters did they disrobe before the child, and the
					child was taken aback.
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - The Servitude: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And as the child hesitated did the master demand to be called by the name the
					child had reserved for the traveler.
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - The Servitude: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the child, overcome with rage that the swine standing before them would
					dare to compare themselves to the traveler, cried out that the master was not
					even worthy to kiss the soles of the traveler's feet!
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - The Servitude: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And with the master's favor revoked was the child shackled and paraded before
					the other slaves, who cheered gleefully at the child's misfortunes, and unto a
					dungeon, for in the morning they were to be sold to a crueler master, and the
					child wept.
				-
			-
				Chapter 19 - The Servitude: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And as the child was locked in was their third eye taken from them, that the
					profit of its sale might cover the so called damages of their insubordination.
				-
		-
			Chapter 20 - The Breakout
		-
			-
				Chapter 20 - The Breakout: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now in the dead of that night did they child hear a horrid cry from outside the
					dungeon.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20 - The Breakout: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Then was the dungeon opened by a face unknown to the child, and the child
					thought this was to be their new master.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20 - The Breakout: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And this enigmatic figure saw that the child was in bondage, and asked the
					child if they would free themselves.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20 - The Breakout: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child knew not how to undo their shackles, but took note of the gaze of
					the enigmatic figure upon a sharp stone, and sliced the chains upon it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20 - The Breakout: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And before the child could even look up so as to thank them had the enigmatic
					figure vanished, yet where they stood sat the child's third eye.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20 - The Breakout: Verse 6
			-
				-
					ANd the child retrieved their treasure, but in fear of the master's wrath did
					the child wait until the morning, yet as morning came with no one did the child
					note a horrid stench in the air.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20 - The Breakout: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the child, mustering up what little courage they had, left the dungeon, and
					followed the scent unto the master's quarters.
				-
			-
				Chapter 20 - The Breakout: Verse 8
			-
				-
					THEN DID THE CHILD CRY OUT IN HORROR AT THE MASTER'S CORPSE, NOW BLOATED AND
					VILE, AND DESPITE THE SINS OF THE MASTER, THE CHILD WEPT FOR THEM.

			Chapter 21 - The Band of Noble Thieves
		-
			-
				Chapter 21 - The Band of Noble Thieves: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And as sirens blared in the distance did the child flee the master's home.
				-
			-
				Chapter 21 - The Band of Noble Thieves: Verse 2
			-
				-
					But as the child ran did they remember the one who saved them, and sought to
					find them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 21 - The Band of Noble Thieves: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child uncovered a trail through their third eye, and upon nightfall
					followed it unto a minor residence at the edge of town, careful to avoid
					detection.
				-
			-
				Chapter 21 - The Band of Noble Thieves: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child came upon the camp of the band of noble thieves, and saw their
					leader sitting among them, and it appeared as though the leader had freed the
					child.
				-
			-
				Chapter 21 - The Band of Noble Thieves: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the child made their presence known, and called unto the leader.
				-
		-
			Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS
		-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the leader inquired upon the child of their origins, and the child spoke of
					the village, and of their trials.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the band was taken aback, for that village may very well have been a legend
					unto them, reserved only for those in the highest favor of the tyrant.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child knew their whole life had been a tragic illusion, and hung their
					head before the band.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now the band protested against the leader that the child carried dead weight
					and a debt of blood upon them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Yet the leader, however reluctantly, looked past dead weight and, in the arts
					of the child, saw opportunity.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the child, despite knowing their weakness, looked past danger and, in the
					strength of the leader and the loyalty of their band, saw safety.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And behind opportunity and behind safety one could almost make out a friend,
					whatever that might mean in such a world.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And the child was alone no more, thus did the child acknowledge the leader.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And the leader held that the child should travel with them, and the leader made
					it known that their decision was final, and the protests of the band ceased.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Yet the child protested unto the leader for the slaying of the master, and so
					the leader denounced the naivete of the child, and thrust them upon the ground,
					and spoke unto them the true law of this world, to kill or be killed, for the
					strong eat the weak.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 11
			-
				-
					And as the child stood up did the leader inquire of how the child had known of
					the master's slaying, thus the child thought it was at that time appropriate to
					thank the leader for their assistance in the dungeon.
				-
			-
				Chapter 22 - EMROY LAKAS: Verse 12
			-
				-
					Yet the leader knew not of the dungeon not of the child's bondage unto the
					master, and all present stood perplexed, and resolved to leave the matter
					unaddressed.
				-
		-
			Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE
		-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And the band, orphans as the child was, had refuge with a benevolent caretaker,
					who sought out unfortunate children to quell the sorrow of having lost their
					own.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Now the caretaker knew not of the violent acts of the band, for their heart
					would be shattered under the weight of such knowledge.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child saw an image of themselves upon the face of the caretaker, and
					speculated of their true lineage, but the caretaker did not know the traveler,
					and yet the child still saw a greater connection in them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now by day the caretaker operated an outlet upon the edge of town, where
					depraved souls came so as to intoxicate themselves, and the caretaker went not
					a day without bearing insults upon their dignity.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Yet the caretaker never fell into despair, for upon night they would return to
					the children, and would feed them well, and console them, and wipe away their
					tears.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now to keep their own spirit afloat did the caretaker seek console in the book
					of the old God, unlawful before the tyrant
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And read unto the children of the book, but as the child recognized in it the
					story the traveler had recited unto them were they reminded of their fallen
					guardian, and though the caretaker sought to wipe away the child's tears, and
					though the child acknowledged the genuine love of the caretaker, the waters of
					their eyes never quite ceased.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And seeing it as a reminder of the traveler did the child take an image of the
					book of the old God unto their third eye.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And the child, having read portions of the book of the old God themselves,
					began to desire further forbidden knowledge.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 10
			-
				-
					And the other members of the band mocked the child for their weakness, but the
					leader asked the child to speak of the of the traveler, and soon the band and
					the caretaker became enamored with the child's account of the traveler and the
					arts they had learned from them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 23 - GRACE HILDE: Verse 11
			-
				-
					And it was through conversing with the children of the band that the child
					learned of their origins in the prophet's machines, cast out as unwanted
					experiments, many plagued with the aftermath of cruel inquiry, even unto that
					day bearing the tyrant's brand upon their flesh.
				-
		-
			Chapter 24 - MIKEEL, SIMBAL, AND SONO-AI
		-
			-
				Chapter 24 - MIKEEL, SIMBAL, AND SONO-AI: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now, in having used the majority of the miniscule profit they made to feed the
					children in their nest was the caretaker was delinquent on the debt of the
					tyrant, and so one day did the wrath of the tyrant come to them, that a quota
					of blood might be filled, and by an unfortunate mishap during their
					interogation was their faith made known.
				-
			-
				Chapter 24 - MIKEEL, SIMBAL, AND SONO-AI: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the caretaker was assured of benign intentions, and instructed to look
					away, but they were not fooled, and for the sake of the children did they cry
					out for mercy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 24 - MIKEEL, SIMBAL, AND SONO-AI: Verse 3
			-
				-
					BUT BY THE WRATH OF THE TYRANT WAS THE CARETAKER STRUCK DOWN FOR THEIR FAITH
					BEFORE THE CHILD AND THE ORPHANS, AND THE CARETAKER CRIED OUT: "MY GOD, MY GOD,
					WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 24 - MIKEEL, SIMBAL, AND SONO-AI: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the wrath of the tyrant cleared their consciences, suggesting among
					themselves that the caretaker bore the face of a demon.
				-
			-
				Chapter 24 - MIKEEL, SIMBAL, AND SONO-AI: Verse 5
			-
				-
					But through the chaos and blood was this cruelty made known unto the people of
					the empire through the third eye of the child, and there was mourning for the
					caretaker, and their corpse became a spark.
				-
		-
			Chapter 25 - The Revolt
		-
			-
				Chapter 25 - The Revolt: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now in the aftermath of the caretake's salying did the band, orphans once
					again, lay the caretaker to rest, and wept for them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 25 - The Revolt: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Yet tears were notably absent from the child's eyes, but as the the leader
					called out the child for their apparant lack of empathy did the child confess
					unto the band and unto the leader that they had been the one who had shown the
					fate of the caretaker unto the people, and the band stood in awe of this
					revelation.
				-
			-
				Chapter 25 - The Revolt: Verse 3
			-
				-
					So, as the fall of the caretaker had incited a great wrath among the camp town,
					the leader proposed a greater conspiracy, that the band should strive to
					amplify the outrage through the child's third eye.
				-
			-
				Chapter 25 - The Revolt: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the schemes of the band bore fruit when the people indeed rebelled against
					the tyrant, yet their feeble efforts were quelled in a single night, and the
					most vocal among them were paraded before the others and unto the gallows.
				-
			-
				Chapter 25 - The Revolt: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Yet this had been the first rebellion since the tyrant's power had been truly
					cemented, and this intrigued the prophet, who came unto the camp town.
				-
			-
				Chapter 25 - The Revolt: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the prophet, with the knowledge of meta, empowered what remained of those
					who still rebelled.
				-
			-
				Chapter 25 - The Revolt: Verse 7
			-
				-
					AND WITH THE POWER OF OF META DID THE PROPHET LEAD A SAVAGE REVOLT AGAINST THE
					WRATH OF THE TYRANT, AND DROVE THEM FROM THE TOWN, AND BEHOLD, THE PEOPLE HAD
					THEIR FIRST TASTE OF VICTORY.
				-
			-
				Chapter 25 - The Revolt: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Yet the taste of victory was bittersweet to the child, for it was tainted with
					the blood on their hands, and the redness upon the ground.
				-
		-
			Chapter 26 - The Fallout
		-
			-
				Chapter 26 - The Fallout: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And in the days following the revolt did other towns across the empire of the
					tyrant begin to rebel, for they had seen the fate of the caretaker and had
					heard of the prophet's victory.
				-
			-
				Chapter 26 - The Fallout: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And though the other revolts failed at first, they continued to occur, and the
					tyrant's resources became strained.
				-
			-
				Chapter 26 - The Fallout: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the situation in the camp town began to imporve, slowly, yet surely.
				-
			-
				Chapter 26 - The Fallout: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And with the arts of the child and before the leader did the band construct a
					new shelter among the ruins left by the revolt.
				-
			-
				Chapter 26 - The Fallout: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And despite their sorrow at the caretaker's passing, the band began to sing
					ever more jovially, for the sun was rising upon the camp town.
				-
		-
			Chapter 27 - The Order
		-
			-
				Chapter 27 - The Order: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And seeing what the child had done unto the tyrant did the leader move the band
					to conspire further schemes against the empire.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27 - The Order: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And with it agreed, in that a brighter world for all lay beyond the tyrant,
					where the sun should rise upon a free and joyful nation, was this truth
					written, and before the leader was the order born.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27 - The Order: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And in time did new and varied faces of orphans come before the leader, and the
					order became mightier by the day.
				-
			-
				Chapter 27 - The Order: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And those who came to dwell among the order revealed that the tyrant sought a
					place where the secrets of the prophet might be discovered, a relic that housed
					the means to their victory or to their downfall, and supposedly sat before the
					image of a three headed beast, and the child became fixated on this rumor.
				-
		-
			Chapter 28 - The Counsel
		-
			-
				Chapter 28 - The Counsel: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now did the tyrant begin to fear that trouble was on the horizon, and they
					called for an emergnecy counsel.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28 - The Counsel: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the counsel resolved that the first among their worries was the prophet and
					their army, but as the prophet came up did the discussion turn to the traveler.
				-
			-
				Chapter 28 - The Counsel: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the tyrant was aware that the child of the traveler had escaped their
					wrath, and so resolved that beyond the issue of the prophet lay a vital need to
					capture and interrogate the child, though this would prove difficult, as the
					child's identity was unknown unto the tyrant and their wrath.
				-
		-
			Chapter 29 - The Clouds
		-
			-
				Chapter 29 - The Clouds: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the order grew did the child cement their place among it as its arm of
					ingenuity.
				-
			-
				Chapter 29 - The Clouds: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And from their third eye and unto the clouds did the child erect a library
					within which to collect and chronicle the canon of their wisdom.
				-
			-
				Chapter 29 - The Clouds: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Yet because their mind alone could not meet the demand for mental manpower that
					the order so desperately needed did the child, with ways developed in their
					discourse with the traveler, forge artificial minds within their third eye,
					slaves unto their will, and set them to keep the library.
				-
		-
			Chapter 30 - IMDRAN CASCA
		-
			-
				Chapter 30 - IMDRAN CASCA: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the order had grown tremendously, and could not stand to bide their time
					any longer, thus did they all resolve to join the crusade of the prophet
					against the tyrant.
				-
			-
				Chapter 30 - IMDRAN CASCA: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And so the next morning did the leader send a scout unto an officer of the
					prophet's forces, to make known the order's wish to partake in the coming
					battles.
				-
			-
				Chapter 30 - IMDRAN CASCA: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Yet the scout returned in dismay, having been told that, though the order's
					resolve was admirable, the prophet will not dirty their hands with the blood of
					child soldiers.
				-
			-
				Chapter 30 - IMDRAN CASCA: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But behold, that very resolve that the prophet praised could not be shaken, and
					so the order plotted to subvert the tyrant's wrath by other means.
				-
		-
			Chapter 31 - The Scheme
		-
			-
				Chapter 31 - The Scheme: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the order convened the the leader stew in their thoughts, until, as a
					spark of plot came unto them, did the child wonder why the leader's vision had
					suddenly fixed on them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 31 - The Scheme: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the leader instructed the child to peer through their third eye and unto
					the silent whisperings of the airwaves, so as to eavesdrop on the scheming of
					the wrath of the tyrant.
				-
			-
				Chapter 31 - The Scheme: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But as the audible conversations, of the tyrant's wrath or otherwise, were
					scarce as is, the child, so that they might still sleep, set an artificial mind
					in their place to listen for the voice of the enemy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 31 - The Scheme: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And as the child's slave kept watch of the silent noise did the leader employ
					the child to lead the order in producing en masse the sort of weapon that makes
					a monster of the ground the enemy sought to march on.
				-
		-
			Chapter 32 - LYNORE IVER
		-
			-
				Chapter 32 - LYNORE IVER: Verse 1

				-
					Now as the child had been put to cerebral work while others among the order
					toiled in manual labor, not unlike when the child served the master, did the
					child's peers begin to resent them for being the recipient of obvious
					favoritism.
				-
			-
				Chapter 32 - LYNORE IVER: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And one in particular, the child's self styled rival, came unto the child as
					they worked, and confronted them regarding their undue privilege.
				-
			-
				Chapter 32 - LYNORE IVER: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now the child's first instinct was to speak to their own defense, but what was
					intended as an alibi was taken as an insult, and the rival pinned the child to
					their desk, and mocked them, that for all their mental might they were
					physically pathetic.
				-
			-
				Chapter 32 - LYNORE IVER: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But the leader came to child's defense, and as they seized the rival away from
					the child did they speak unto the rival with blades in their words so sharp
					that even the child's skin was made to crawl.
				-
			-
				Chapter 32 - LYNORE IVER: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the child, hating to watch the one sided abuse play out, spoke to the
					rival's defense, acknowleging the fundamental unfairness of the situation, and
					so the leader reluctantly relented, and cast the rival to the ground before
					storming off.
				-
			-
				Chapter 32 - LYNORE IVER: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And as the rival struggled to pick themselves up did the child stretch out
					their hand unto them, so as to pull them up, but the rival slapped the child's
					hand away, and returned to their work, for though they still resented the
					child, they knew in their heart that the tyrant was the true enemy.

			-
				Chapter 33 - The Accident: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the traps were forged were they laid benath the earth, intended for
					those who plotted against the peace, but though the order had warned the locals
					of the danger, a beloved elder was made a victim of their senile state, and
					there was an outcry against the order as bits of the elder's body rained down.
				-
			-
				Chapter 33 - The Accident: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Yet as the tension of the public approached a boiling point, and a call was
					made for the heads of those responsible, the leader, in their cunning, bore
					false witness unto the people, quelling the outrage by shifting the blame unto
					the tyrant.
				-
			-
				Chapter 33 - The Accident: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But in the same despair that swept over the area did the child, feeling
					responsible for the work of the works of their hand, weep for the elder's sake,
					and questioned their resolve unto the order's cause, for they knew that the
					path of war was to be paved in red unto its very end, yet in their foresight of
					it could not distinguish their own blood from that of the enemy, thus did they
					contemplate desertion.
				-
			-
				Chapter 33 - The Accident: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But in their uncertainty did an inaudible voice echo within their dream, saying
					to stand with the order, and though the child strived to decouple the strange
					voice from their own, it began to seem that they were one and the same, and
					thus was the matter settled.
				-
		-
			Chapter 34 - The Trap
		-
			-
				Chapter 34 - The Trap: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And it came to pass that the child's slave intelligence had indeed locked onto
					the whisperings of the wrath of the tyrant, and the child weaved a net within
					their third eye so as to derive a voice in the image of an enemy soldier, and
					with that voice did the leader misdirect the wrath of the tyrant unto the trap
					engineered by the order.
				-
			-
				Chapter 34 - The Trap: Verse 2
			-
				-
					AND BEHOLD, BY THE WORKS OF MERE CHILDREN WAS THE SKY OVER THE TOWN PAINTED RED
					WITH THE BLOOD AND BONE OF A FULLY ARMED BATTALION, WHO MERE MOMENTS BEFORE HAD
					SO PROUDLY WAVED THE TYRANT'S FLAG.
				-
			-
				Chapter 34 - The Trap: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And though the child would under normal circumstances be taken aback by such a
					sight, it was seen, to the mild horror of those by their side, that they bore a
					sick sort of glee in their laughing expression, but even the child was
					disturbed by this as they returned unto their senses.
				-
			-
				Chapter 34 - The Trap: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But by the time the child had emerged from their madness had it proven
					contagious, most of all to the leader, who proposed a toast unto the child over
					the corpses of their enemy, with a feast funded by the spoils looted from the
					remains upon the ground.
				-
			-
				Chapter 34 - The Trap: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Thus did the feast commence, and though the child thought the whole affair to
					be in bad taste, they were unable to restrain themselves, having for so long
					been denied the affluence the traveler had raised them with, and the order was
					surprised that one so petite could be so gluttonous, at least by their
					standards.
				-
			-
				Chapter 34 - The Trap: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And as the child retired to bed, on the first full stomach they had known since
					the death of the traveler, did they remember that the next day was the
					aniversary of their birth, and as they contemplated the signifigance of the
					passing of their thirteenth sun did they recall in their dream how they had
					celebrated the passing of previous suns with the traveler.
				-
			-
				Chapter 34 - The Trap: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Indeed, as it was upon the thirteenth sun, that in the tradition of the
					traveler's ancestors were children said to become adults before the old God,
					the was sun about to set upon the child's childhood.
				-

				Chapter 35 - The Alarm: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now though the children had indeed managed a triumph over the wrath of the
					tyrant, they were nonetheless children still, and in their revelry had exposed
					their presence unto prying eyes, and the wrath of the tyrant mobilized a
					greater force to lay ambush upon the children.
				-
			-
				Chapter 35 - The Alarm: Verse 2
			-
				-
					AND AS THE CHILDREN LAY SLEEPING DID THE WRATH OF THE TYRANT STORM THE TOWN IN
					VENGEANCE FOR THEIR FALLEN COMRADES, MOWING DOWN ANY WHO STOOD IN THEIR PATH,
					AND TRAMPLING OVER THE GRAVE OF THE ELDER MADE VICTIM OF THE ACCIDENT.
				-
			-
				Chapter 35 - The Alarm: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now though the majority of the children failed to notice the approaching
					danger, the scout was just aware enough at the critical moment to raise the
					alarm, violently waking the others, even if they were as stubborn as the child
					was in their slumber.
				-
			-
				Chapter 35 - The Alarm: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the scout left together with the leader as the others cowered for cover in
					their abode, but as they left did the rival chase after them, despite the
					protests of the child for their sake, and for such protests did the rival curse
					the child's percieved cowardice in retort.
				-
		-
			Chapter 36 - The Casualty
		-
			-
				Chapter 36 - The Casualty: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the leader and the scout slinked together through the alleys did the
					rival approach from behind, but in their surprise did the leader take aim upon
					the rival before realizing their error.
				-
			-
				Chapter 36 - The Casualty: Verse 2
			-
				-
					But before the trio could formulate any sort of plan were they forced to take
					cover as a soldier crossed the cross section of the corner, and though the
					rival wanted to attack, the scout cautioned against alerting the others surely
					lurking nearby, a point that the rival reluctantly acknowledged.
				-
			-
				Chapter 36 - The Casualty: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But as the children, having seen what they needed to, began to make their way
					back to their abode did they witness a group of soldiers planting a bomb
					adjacent to their home.
				-
			-
				Chapter 36 - The Casualty: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And knowing the urgency of the situation did the scout shoot one of the
					soldiers in the back.
				-
			-
				Chapter 36 - The Casualty: Verse 5
			-
				-
					BUT AS THE SOLDIER LAY THERE DYING DID THEIR COMRADE TAKE AIM UPON THE SCOUT,
					AND THOUGH THE RIVAL TACKLED THE SCOUT OUT OF THE WAY, THEY WERE BOTH STRUCK.
				-
			-
				Chapter 36 - The Casualty: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now in revenge did the leader take the opening to shoot dead the second soldier
					and the rest who still stood, but the leader had failed to verify that they
					were indeed dead. 
				-
			-
				Chapter 36 - The Casualty: Verse 7
			-
				-
					AND THE SOLDIER SHOT BY THE SCOUT USED WHAT LITTLE STRENGTH REMAINED IN THEM TO
					REPAY UNTO THE SCOUT THEIR FAVOR, AND THE SCOUT WAS STRUCK THROUGH THE HEAD.
				-
			-
				Chapter 36 - The Casualty: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Now as the leader and the rival looked towards the soldier in shock and in
					agony did the soldier ask of them what they expected in playing soldier,
					telling the children, in their dying breath, that good and evil do not exist on
					the fields of battle, nay, only blood, and tears, merging into one as they
					paint the ground red.
				-
		-
			Chapter 37 - The Arrival
		-
			-
				Chapter 37 - The Arrival: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now several soldiers, having heard the gunshots, desended unto the location of
					the children, and the leader cradled the limp body of the rival in their arms,
					that they need not meet their end alone.
				-
			-
				Chapter 37 - The Arrival: Verse 2
			-
				-
					But as the footsteps drew nearer did they seem to shrink in number as gunshots
					echoed through the alleys.
				-
			-
				Chapter 37 - The Arrival: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now at last did a soldier run past the children, and as the leader took aim
					upon them with the rival cowering in their arms did the soldier take aim upon
					the leader, but the soldier hesitated as they noticed the bodies of the other
					soldiers lying dead beside the children.
				-
			-
				Chapter 37 - The Arrival: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And as the soldier paused did the leader notice the emblem upon the soldier,
					that it was of the prophet's rebellion!
				-
			-
				Chapter 37 - The Arrival: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the leader cried out "we are with you!"
				-
			-
				Chapter 37 - The Arrival: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now the soldier paused for a moment, before taking out a transciever, relaying
					the nature of the situation to their comrades, and as they awaited backup did
					they stand guard over the children, tending to the rival's wounds with what
					they had learned in that art from the prophet and demanding an account of
					everything from the leader.
				-
			-
				Chapter 37 - The Arrival: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And as the backup the soldier called for arrived did the fighting in the city
					continue, until only after the streets had been painted red did the rebellion
					succeed in driving off the wrath of the tyrant.
				-
		-
			Chapter 38 - The Compromise
		-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the fighting came to a close did the soldier that had come in defense of
					the children, having come to terms with the leader's account, call for the
					prophet to come unto the children in person.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the children, learning of the scouts demise, mourned them, and the child
					collapsed upon the leader, crying.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now, while still reluctant to entertain the order, the prophet did acknowledge
					their earlier triumph, and came unto their abode.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And though the majority of the order trembled in the prophet's presence, the
					child being no exception, the leader stood firm.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Now did the prophet make clear that they remained strong in their resolve not
					to employ children as soldiers, but the leader, knowing that the prophet's word
					on that matter was final, instead proposed a compromise, that the order might
					still serve in the prophet's army, not as soldiers, but as support.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the prophet began to think it over, but before responding, they asked to
					see the rival, that they might assist in tending to their wounds.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 7
			-
				-
					BUT AS THE RIVAL'S ARM WAS EXPOSED UNTO THE PROPHET WAS THE PROPHET MADE AWARE
					OF THE ORIGINS OF THE CHILDREN, CREATED IN THE PROPHET'S OWN CREATIONS, AND
					THOUGH RESTRAINED, THE PROPHET NONETHELESS BEGAN TO WEEP AS THEY UNDERSTOOD THE
					NATURE OF THE ORDER'S WILL TO FIGHT.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And after working wonders upon the rival to the awe of those present to behold,
					the prophet requested to speak unto each member of the order privately.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And one by one did the prophet begin to view the children as their children,
					and at last, after all the others, came unto the child to speak with them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Now the prophet noted that among all of the children of the order that it was
					the child alone who did not bear the mark of the tyrant, but as the prophet had
					been made aware of the signifigance of the child's contributions in their
					discussions with the other children, the rival having been especially obsessed
					with the subject, the prophet was moved to inquire regarding what had brought
					the child unto the order.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 11
			-
				-
					And the child spoke of how they came from the village, and of the tragic fate
					that had befallen the traveler, who had taught them all that they knew.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 12
			-
				-
					And the prophet paused.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 13
			-
				-
					And the prophet, beginning to suspect the truth, asked the child to utter their
					family name.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 14
			-
				-
					And the child did.
				-
			-
				Chapter 38 - The Compromise: Verse 15
			-
				-
					AND THE PROPHET BEGAN TO WEEP UNCONTROLABLY, AND THEY EMBRACED THE CHILD AS
					THEY COLLAPSED UNTO THEM, YET THEY COULD NOT BRING THEMSELVES TO TELL THE CHILD
					WHY.
				-
		-
			Chapter 39 - The Acceptance
		-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And the prophet's weeping was heard by all who stood outside the room wherein
					the prophet and the child conversed.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Now as the prophet emerged from the sealed room did the leader prompt the
					prophet for their verdict.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the prophet, whose tears were only now beginning to dry, made it known, in
					a choked stammer, that the order was to accompany them to the one of the many
					headquarters of the resistence, and to begin their training at dawn the very
					next morning.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the order rejoiced, and despite the tears, a smile came over the prophet's
					face as they ushered the children towards the resistence aircraft.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And before boarding, the rival turned unto the child, and though it was silent,
					and though it was reluctant, there was an honest exchange of regret and respect
					between the two.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 6
			-
				-
					But before the order finally departed from the camp town that they had saved
					and unto their new lives as instruments in a war that would play out on a
					greater scale than their young minds could comprehend, the child still had one
					nagging question that they had to get off their chest.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And so, as they were about to depart, the child asked unto the prophet
					regarding the supposed cave upon the mountain, and of the power that dwelt
					within.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And the prophet paused.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And with a stern expression, the prophet turned unto the child, and told them
					of a great and terrible monster that had slain all who had chased the rumor of
					the summit, and though the child was yet unsatisifed, the prophet made it known
					that there was to be no more discussion on the matter.
				-
			-
				Chapter 39 - The Acceptance: Verse 10
			-
				-
					And so the aircraft took off, and as they rose into the sky did the children
					collectively pass the onva of their coming of age in the eyes of the new God,
					who bore witness to their ascent.
				-
		-
			Chapter 40 - The Probe
		-
			-
				Chapter 40 - The Probe: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the aircraft flew unto the abode of the resistence did the prophet,
					having taken as spoils of order's triumph the still living body of an imperial
					soldier, seek to toy with their prey in the private quarters of the ship.
				-
			-
				Chapter 40 - The Probe: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And though the poor creature could not talk through a broken neck, the prophet,
					not wanting their prize to go to waste, removed the victim's mind from their
					skull, and placed it into a machine through which the soul within might still
					speak.
				-
			-
				Chapter 40 - The Probe: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the prophet was as a puppet master unto a marionette, pulling a string of
					nerve wherever there came an impasse in the conversation, and in the end proved
					victorious, having gained the knowledge they sought.
				-
			-
				Chapter 40 - The Probe: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Yet, though the prophet had indeed made a fool of their quarry, it seemed the
					tyrant had done the same before them, for there was nothing of use in the
					soldier's testimony, as it was shown that they were nothing more than a blind
					pawn in a scheme that stretched far beyond them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 40 - The Probe: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the soldier watched as the prophet faded from the vision projected unto
					them, before screaming out silently as the prophet terminated the spirit in the
					flask.
				-
		-
			Chapter 41 - The Drill
		-
			-
				Chapter 41 - The Drill: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now did the sun rise upon a new era for the members of the order, who though
					still children in body, were, as a consequnece of their own wishes, no longer
					so in spirit.
				-
			-
				Chapter 41 - The Drill: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And without warning were the new soldiers in training called from out of their
					beds to stand before an officer of the prophet's army for their first set of
					drills.
				-
			-
				Chapter 41 - The Drill: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And even by military standards were the trials of the resistence harsh, and it
					was seen, that though the child excelled in the classroom, they floundered
					physically, for as the rival had said, the child was soft, their condition the
					fruit of the traveler's affluence.
				-
			-
				Chapter 41 - The Drill: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And though, after too many bruises to count, had the child foresaken the idea
					of sparring with their peers, and especially with the leader, let alone the
					rival and despaired that they lacked the strength they would inevitably need to
					serve in the coming battles, but the prophet warned them not to give up, for
					regardless of their stature, the world would not forgive them of their
					weakness.
				-
		-
			Chapter 42 - The Automaton
		-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 1
			-
				-
					But one day did the prophet return from a convention with their front, and
					among the spoils of their triumphs was the scrap of a training automaton.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child saw in this machine another route unto physical might, and so did
					the child repair the automaton.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And in their foresight had the child, so as to test it, set the machine to its
					lowest power output.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But upon its activation did the machine charge the child, pinning them to the
					ground, and the child stuggled against their iron opponent.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Yet as the leader heard the child's cry and came to assist did the child order
					them to stand back.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And though it took several minutes did the child eventually manage to free
					their arm, and with it, shut off the machine, and cast it off of them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And though they stood, bruised and panting, their spirit was not broken, but in
					fact set alight, and in the coming days did the child train further with the
					machine.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And eventually, through a grueling cycle of trial, error, and growth was the
					child able to best the machine, and so began to increase its strength, that
					their own might rise with it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And one day, after several moons had passed, did the child see it fit to spar
					once more with their peers, but this time knocked their opponent from their
					feet with a single strike, and the order beheld the fruits of the child's
					training, that the child's once soft physique was beginning to give way to a
					more toned exterior.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Now though the child still could not best the leader in combat, they could at
					least hold their own.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 11
			-
				-
					And not wanting to be left in the dust did the other members of the order begin
					to train with the automaton also, and having seen the physical application of
					the child's arts, sought to learn of them at sessions that went long into the
					night with the child as their adjunct professor, and the rival and the leader
					were among the most eager pupils, though the rival would not admit it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 42 - The Automaton: Verse 12
			-
				-
					And whenever asked how it was that the child had come to be so strong in the
					arts, in their humility was the credit always given to the traveler, for all
					great teachers surely have a great teacher of their own to thank for their
					gifts of giving.
				-
		-
			Chapter 43 - The Vengeance
		-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the order continued in their training with the army of the prophet did
					they assist in the war effort by way of labor and intelligence.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And one day did the child, using the same scheme they had used before to lure
					the wrath of the tyrant into their trap, delivered the slayers of the caretaker
					into the hands of the prophet.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And as all present had seen the slaying of the caretaker, either in person or
					after the fact, did they come to watch as the prophet brutalized the killers
					into submission, and extracted everything their was to take from them, relavent
					or otherwise.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the prophet, desiring that the show should end in a proper climax, called
					unto the children to decide whether the killers would be granted mercy or
					justice.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And all present presented a unanimous verdict, pointing their thumbs towards
					hell.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And at that moment did the child walk into the room, unaware of what had been
					taking place, as they had been caught up in their work.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 7
			-
				-
					So, with the duties of judge and jury fulfilled did the prophet call unto the
					child to play the role of executioner.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And the child hesitated, remembering the trauma of having slain the scout who
					slew the traveler, but possessed no the spine to rebel against the pressure of
					their peers.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And the prophet gave unto the child a perfectly ordinary weapon, and assisted
					the child in aiming upon the condemned, who hung their heads in acceptence.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Now even with the gun in their hand did the child hesitate, thus were they
					shocked when the prophet pulled the trigger for them, painting the room red.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 11
			-
				-
					And all present cheered with a wrathful ecstasy as the rest were disposed of,
					and at the conclusion of the affair did the prophet raise up the child's hand
					in triumph, proclaiming the child's tears tears of joy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 43 - The Vengeance: Verse 12
			-
				-
					Now after the audience had left did the prophet hand the child a rag with which
					to wipe away their tears, and said unto the child that if they were to cry upon
					dirtying their hands in war then surely they would end up drowning in their own
					tears before long.
				-
		-
			Chapter 44 - The Split
		-
			-
				Chapter 44 - The Split: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now after two suns lengths of training, upon the fifteeth anniversary of the
					child's birth, was the order to be sent on a training excursion upon the remote
					and freezing peaks of a vast mountain range.
				-
			-
				Chapter 44 - The Split: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And as the order approached a series of narrow passes did the leader instruct
					the order to split in three, and tasked the child to lead one, and as the
					leader pondered over who was to lead the third did the rival volunteer.
				-
			-
				Chapter 44 - The Split: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the three groups were to reconvene at that location after taking note of
					the ends of each path.
				-
			-
				Chapter 44 - The Split: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now after several hours did the child's group and the leader's group return
					unto the meeting place, but the rival's group had yet to show, and the child
					began to suspect the worst.
				-
			-
				Chapter 44 - The Split: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And so the two groups waited until nightfall, but still there was no sign of
					the rival's group.
				-
		-
			Chapter 45 - The Avalanche
		-
			-
				Chapter 45 - The Avalanche: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And then, without warning, did an avalanche come crashing down the mountain,
					and the present members of the order saw that it had come down over the path
					that the rival's group took.
				-
			-
				Chapter 45 - The Avalanche: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child's spirit shattered as they began rambling neurotically regarding
					the apparant fate of the rival and their group.
				-
			-
				Chapter 45 - The Avalanche: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Yet as the child contemplated turning back did the leader rally those present
					to action, and as the child questioned the judgement behind the leader's
					nobility did the same voice that had spoken unto them over two suns ago echo
					within them again, saying once more to trust in the leader, and so, however
					relucatantly, the child did.
				-
		-
			Chapter 46 - The Skirmish
		-
			-
				Chapter 46 - The Skirmish: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the rescue effort proceeded did it begin to seem as though the child's
					premonitions were correct, until gunfire was heard in the distance.
				-
			-
				Chapter 46 - The Skirmish: Verse 2
			-
				-
					As upon hearing the shots did all present duck for cover, and the child noted
					that the shots came from behind a wall of snow, and unto a valley below, and
					the child, peering unto the valley through their third eye, saw the wrath of
					the tyrant firing back unto the peak.
				-
			-
				Chapter 46 - The Skirmish: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the leader told the child to take their party unto the peak while the
					leader's party would engage the wrath of the tyrant.
				-
			-
				Chapter 46 - The Skirmish: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And as the child proceeded unto the summit did they note through their third
					eye the faint traces of heat of numerous enemy soldiers buried beneath the
					snow.
				-
		-
			Chapter 47 - The Rescue
		-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the child and their party approached the summit did the gunfire begin to
					cease, but as the child approached the summit did someone behind a wall of snow
					fire in the child's direction, and the search party took cover.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 2
			-
				-
					But as the members of the party drew their arms in retaliation against who they
					assumed was of the wrath of the tyrant did the child order their part to hold
					fire, and called unto who they knew was the rival.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the rival's party, recognizing the child's voice, responded in turn, and
					made it known that they were trapped.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 4
			-
				-
					So the child, wasting no time, contacted the leader's party, but not being so
					naive as to make the same blunders as the tyrant's wrath were the letters of
					their communication wrapped in an machine's enigma.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the leader made it know that they had fended off the enemy and were thus en
					route to the child's location, and so did the child and their party begin the
					work of pulling the rival and their party from beneath the snow.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And as members of the rival's party were pulled from the snow did they reveal
					that the rival, seeing the tyrant's wrath ascending the mountain en masse, and
					taking into account the lessons learned from the child, called to trigger the
					avalanche, lest their party be overrun, and the villages past them be in
					jeopardy, and the child stood in awe of the rival's ingenuity.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 7
			-
				-
					But, having been held captive by the weight of the snow had several among the
					rival's party, the rival themselves among them, begun to fade into that good
					night, their blood running cold.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And as the leader arrived on the scene did they and their party join the
					child's party in delivering the rival and their party from the brink of death.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And though the deadline of the excursion that night was an unspoken ruling made
					that human life took priority, and though several souls were lost in the
					struggle to preseve the few that could be helped, the child and the leader,
					working together, were successful in pulling the rival from the maw of the
					void.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 10
			-
				-
					And as the rival breathed of the breath of life did the leader breath the
					breath of relief, and as the leader looked upon the rival did the child look
					upon the leader, wondering when it was that they had become so fair to look
					upon.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 11
			-
				-
					And the child pondered over whether the voice that had told them to trust in
					the leader was the voice of the child's feelings for them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 47 - The Rescue: Verse 12
			-
				-
					So, with hearts heavy for the warriors lost but spirits raised for the
					civilians saved did the leader call unto the order to return unto the prophet.
				-
		-
			Chapter 48 - The Dismissal
		-
			-
				Chapter 48 - The Dismissal: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the order had overstayed their alotted time upon the summit did the
					prophet demand an alibi for their tardiness, and the leader began to defend the
					order did the prophet dismiss their excuses.
				-
			-
				Chapter 48 - The Dismissal: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And as the prophet berated the leader did the rival come forth, taking
					responsibility for the delay.
				-
			-
				Chapter 48 - The Dismissal: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And it could be seen to a discerning eye that the prophet was indeed moved by
					the rival's cunning, bravery, and humility, but as the rival had been injured
					in the affair, and as they had in fact been responsible for the events that
					transpired, the prophet made it known that they were relieved of duty.
				-
			-
				Chapter 48 - The Dismissal: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the rival, understanding that it was for the best, and with their head
					hung, went out from under the prophet, who though assaulted by the protests of
					the order, and especially of the child, would not be moved, and the rival went
					to leave.
				-
			-
				Chapter 48 - The Dismissal: Verse 5
			-
				-
					But as the rival went to leave, the child ran unto them, and embraced them, and
					the child said that despite the differences between them, the rival would be
					missed, and the rival embraced the child in return, yet then left without
					saying a word.
				-
		-
			Chapter 49 - The Waves
		-
			-
				Chapter 49 - The Waves: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now that night, as the rival headed out from under the order, with no
					particular place to go, did they come upon the shore of a nearby beach, and
					there did they sulk as the sun set.
				-
			-
				Chapter 49 - The Waves: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the rival cursed the child, wondering why it was they had to say such a
					thing at the last second, adding pointless inquiry to the injury of the insult.
				-
			-
				Chapter 49 - The Waves: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Yet as dusk gave way to night did the rival begin to calm, soothed by the
					beauty of a full moon.
				-
			-
				Chapter 49 - The Waves: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But as the moonlight illuminated the number of their birth upon their arm was
					the rival once again enraged, reminded of the unfinished mission they had
					failed, and overcome with self loathing did they seek the release of the good
					night, and their tears melted into the waters as they proceeded into the waves,
					ready to ride the undertow straight into hell.
				-
			-
				Chapter 49 - The Waves: Verse 5
			-
				-
					But just as the rival's head was about to be submerged did a voice echo within
					them, saying "how dare you seek to throw away your gift of life when others are
					yet in need of you?"
				-
		-
			Chapter 50 - KIMANI
		-
			-
				Chapter 50 - KIMANI: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And the rival's foot struck something moving beneath the waves.
				-
			-
				Chapter 50 - KIMANI: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Now the rival looked down to see that a red stream was erupting from the
					seafloor, and so rival, in a sudden panic, dove down to retrieve whatever
					creature was struggling for its life.
				-
			-
				Chapter 50 - KIMANI: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the rival lifted the creature up unto the surface, revealing the form of a
					dolphin wounded by what appeared to be the bite of a shark.
				-
			-
				Chapter 50 - KIMANI: Verse 4
			-
				-
					So despite the wounded animal's immense weight did the rival drag its limp body
					back towards the shore, and once in shallower waters did the rival lay down the
					poor creature so as to tend to its injury.
				-
			-
				Chapter 50 - KIMANI: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the rival labored throughout the night, cleverly employing that which the
					child had taught them regarding medical matters, and in doing so made known the
					child unto the dolphin, who unbeknownst to the rival was not entirely ignorant
					of human speech.
				-
			-
				Chapter 50 - KIMANI: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And as dawn rose was the last of the dolphin's spilled blood swept away into
					the waters, and the dolphin suddenly lept away from the shore, knocking them
					back as they danced in the waves as the sun rose, and the rival broke into a
					fot of joyous laughter, relieved to see that their efforts were not in vain.
				-
			-
				Chapter 50 - KIMANI: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the rival stayed by the dolphin's side until dusk came once again, so as to
					ensure that the dolphin recovered enough to set out to sea, and as the moon
					rose that night did it become clear to the rival that the dolphin had long
					since recovered enough to leave their side, and satyed only because they did
					not want to.
				-
		-
			Chapter 51 - The Parting
		-
			-
				Chapter 51 - The Parting: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now knowing that the dolphin for its own sake must leave did the rival bid it
					off, but the stubborn animal would not budge, and so the rival began to chuck
					rocks in its direction, but still it would not leave.
				-
			-
				Chapter 51 - The Parting: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Yet as the rival began to give into despair did the dolphin's pod, who had been
					searching for it, call unto the shore, and the dolphin turned in their
					direction before looking back towards the rival.
				-
			-
				Chapter 51 - The Parting: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And as the dolphin looked back in the direction of the pod did the rival run to
					embrace them, bidding them farewell, and the dolphin responded in its own
					tongue before departing into the sea, and though the rival was alone once
					again, they once again had faith in the justification of their existence.

			Chapter 52 - The Graduation
		-
			-
				Chapter 52 - The Graduation: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the order began to recover from their order upon the summit and the
					shock of the rival's dismissal were they set to graduate unto proper service,
					and as the leader was made a tactician was the child made to serve dual roles,
					as an engineer and as an agent of espionage.
				-
			-
				Chapter 52 - The Graduation: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the newly minted soldiers of the order proved a wise investment as they
					triumphed time after time in the fight against the tyrant over the course of
					the next sun.
				-
		-
			Chapter 53 - The Trouble
		-
			-
				Chapter 53 - The Trouble: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the prophet knew the value of the child's ingenuity did they see to it
					that the child's missions were not extrordinarily hazardous.
				-
			-
				Chapter 53 - The Trouble: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And after one sun had passed was the child sent unto a remote town past the
					mountain where the rival had buried the wrath of the tyrant, so as to scout out
					its politics and vulnerabilities.
				-
			-
				Chapter 53 - The Trouble: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child, having completed their day's work, and having picked up
					epicurian tastes in their travels, went to dine at a local establishment.
				-
			-
				Chapter 53 - The Trouble: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But as the child mingled among the not enitrely savory crowd was the peace
					disturbed by a troupe of local bandits, and all present were robbed of their
					money at gunpoint, and the child, having descended into a drunken spell, was in
					no position to fight back.
				-
			-
				Chapter 53 - The Trouble: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the child awoke hours later to find themselves shackled unto a moving cart,
					deprived of their money and of their third eye, and destined for the most vile
					corner of that city.
				-
		-
			Chapter 54 - The Duel
		-
			-
				Chapter 54 - The Duel: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now in those latter days was placing bets upon underground duels a popular
					pastime among the elite, but it was a much riskier pursuit for the competitors,
					for though victory by ringout was tolerated, victory by death paid far more
					handsomely.
				-
			-
				Chapter 54 - The Duel: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child, was taken before an arena, and handed over at gunpoint, so as to
					be the night's entertainment.
				-
			-
				Chapter 54 - The Duel: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now normally the scum of the city would scout one such as the child to act as a
					"dancer", for lack of a better word, but this night did it seem the child was
					to take part in the main event.
				-
			-
				Chapter 54 - The Duel: Verse 4
			-
				-
					So as the child was awaiting their turn in the ring were they told to change
					into proper arena attire, that is to say, something a tad more revealing than
					to which the child was accustomed, but not entirely indecent.
				-
		-
			Chapter 55 - The Ring
		-
			-
				Chapter 55 - The Ring: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now, the situation being as it was, and being so exposed, might have normally
					troubled the child, they were not so disturbed this night, for in enjoying the
					fruits of their training, they had, though they did not like to admit it, grown
					somewhat vain in their pride, and beyond that, regarding a truth they would
					also prefer not to admit, they enjoyed a good fight.
				-
			-
				Chapter 55 - The Ring: Verse 2
			-
				-
					If only that is what this night was to be, and the child knew to begin plotting
					their escape even as their hour approached, but from such an empty pot of
					possibilities, they could only draw a blank.
				-
			-
				Chapter 55 - The Ring: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child was beginning to worry as they watched the defeated contestants
					of the matches leading up to theirs being carried out on stretchers, some
					moving, some not.
				-
			-
				Chapter 55 - The Ring: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And at last was the child finally called into the ring as the clock approached
					midnight, their match slated to be the final round of that show.
				-
			-
				Chapter 55 - The Ring: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And they entered the ring covered in a robe as is tradition in many such
					sports, greeted by a mixture of curiosities, not all of it positive.
				-
		-
			Chapter 56 - The Encounter
		-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 1
			-
				-
					But the murmurs of the crowd suddenly fell silent as all eyes turned unto a
					large and imposing figure who had entered from the back, and was now being
					ushered up to a priviledged booth, followed closely by one of significantly
					smaller stature, and surrounded by armed guards.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And as the figure entered their booth did the child ask the slack jawed agent
					in their corner of the identity of the stranger.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the agent, in a hushed but stern voice, chastised the child for asking such
					a stupid question, for it was none other than the tyrant themselves, followed
					by their heir.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child was taken aback, for they had never actually seen the tyrant
					before now, and had in their mind's eye pictured a more dimunitive and cowardly
					figure than the hulking statue before them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And though the child at first glance saw they opportunity to strike a victory
					blow for the resistence, they knew that they could not pull off such a scheme
					in their current state.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now the tyrant took interest in the child, noting the child's status as a
					newcomer, and called for them to cast off their garment.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And with all eyes upon them did the child do as they had been told, and the
					tyrant stood impressed, and asked the child of their identity, to which the
					child replied with an alias.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And the tyrant questioned the child regarding their opinion of the nobles and
					aristocrats in the crowd.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And as the child hesitated did the tyrant say that their silence spoke volumes,
					of a note to which the tyrant themselves agreed, having little patience for
					spoiled parasites, and thus did the tyrant offer to let the child choose such a
					swine to slaughter should they win.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 10
			-
				-
					And as the members of the crowd cowered in fear, and though the child
					considered nominating the scum who had captured and sold them as they had been
					sold unto the master before, did the child respectfully decline the tyrant's
					offer
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 11
			-
				-
					And the tyrant praised the child's bravery, and their nobility, but noted that
					this arena was no place for the latter, though they did allow the child their
					choice.
				-
			-
				Chapter 56 - The Encounter: Verse 12
			-
				-
					And the tyrant wished the child luck, for they would need it if they were to
					make it out alive.
				-
		-
			Chapter 57 - HANTRA SHENEN
		-
			-
				Chapter 57 - HANTRA SHENEN: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the tyrant took their seat was attention drawn unto the corner opposite
					the child, from where their opponent emerged to thunderous applause.
				-
			-
				Chapter 57 - HANTRA SHENEN: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And as the opponent entered the ring and cast off their robe was the child
					taken aback as the figure, many suns the child's senior, stood before and
					towered over them, clearly not an opponent befitting of the child's stature.
				-
			-
				Chapter 57 - HANTRA SHENEN: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child could see in the opponent's eye that the giant had in mind that
					the night should conclude in a bloody resolution, and that a single direct blow
					from the beast would be their end.
				-
			-
				Chapter 57 - HANTRA SHENEN: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now as the match was set to begin did the opponent give their hand unto the
					child, as was custom, and the child, swallowing their fear, reached back, and
					was shocked upon feeling the sheer force of the opponent's grip.
				-
			-
				Chapter 57 - HANTRA SHENEN: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And as the fighters' hands parted did they become fists as the fight began, and
					the child only narrowly dodged the opponent's first punch, jumping across the
					arena in the process.
				-
		-
			Chapter 58 - The Fight
		-
			-
				Chapter 58 - The Fight: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And each successive blow of the opponent was like unto the child as a steam
					piston, and a broken bone should it connect directly.
				-
			-
				Chapter 58 - The Fight: Verse 2
			-
				-
					But the opponent, in their arrogance, fought only with brute strength, and the
					child knew from training with the automaton on higher settings that the weight
					of such opponents could be turned against them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 58 - The Fight: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Thus did David derive a scheme to sling upon Goliath.
				-
			-
				Chapter 58 - The Fight: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And with every punch did the child err to the opponent's side, observing their
					habits, and waiting for a window.
				-
			-
				Chapter 58 - The Fight: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And when the opportunity presented itself did the child redirect the opponent's
					strike upward, and without wasting any time, kicked the opponent upon their
					liver.
				-
			-
				Chapter 58 - The Fight: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And following through on the cunning of the first phase did the child first
					strike up upon the opponent's nose, painting their face red, and then down unto
					where no fair fight would go.
				-
			-
				Chapter 58 - The Fight: Verse 7
			-
				-
					So with the opponent writhing in pain did the child lift up the giant's leg so
					as to have the beast fall upon their face.
				-
			-
				Chapter 58 - The Fight: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Now with the opponent down did the child see it fit to finish the fight for
					good, by leaping and landing upon the opponent's neck.
				-
			-
				Chapter 58 - The Fight: Verse 9
			-
				-
					But the child hesitated.
				-
		-
			Chapter 59 - The Struggle
		-
			-
				Chapter 59 - The Struggle: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the opponent rose from their fall did a child, taking flight from the
					fight, noted the fiery fury in the opponent's disgraced expression.
				-
			-
				Chapter 59 - The Struggle: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And as the child sought to derive a new scheme did the opponent charge the
					child with a wrath that seemed to erupt from them as an aura of anger.
				-
			-
				Chapter 59 - The Struggle: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And as the child deflected a blow from the opponent did the giant, with greater
					cunning than they had earlier employed, seize the child by their face and
					pinned them against the floor, so as to end the match with the child.
				-
			-
				Chapter 59 - The Struggle: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now the child, in a primal panic, opened their mouth to draw in what little
					breath they could, but though no wind came, a voice did.
				-
			-
				Chapter 59 - The Struggle: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And behold, it was the same voice that had spoken to the child previously in
					their moments of despair, and it said "this is not how your story ends".
				-
			-
				Chapter 59 - The Struggle: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now as the beast was about to bring their fist down upon the child did they
					hesitate, seeing in the child's helpless face the likeness of one they could
					never strike, but as the giant stalled did the child's awareness fade as a
					primal rage emerged in its place, and the child bit down upon the beast's hand,
					and as the opponent lifted up their hand so as to actually strike the child was
					the child's arm freed.
				-
			-
				Chapter 59 - The Struggle: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And as the opponent brought their hand down unto the child did the child sweep
					it to the side and, with the brief window opened, plunged their thumb into the
					opponent's eye, staining it red.
				-
			-
				Chapter 59 - The Struggle: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Now as the opponent recoiled in pain did they lift the child up with them, and
					the child exploited the momentum to sling their knee into the giant's face.
				-
			-
				Chapter 59 - The Struggle: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And as the giant's grip loosened did the child leap off and onto their feet,
					sending the opponent stumbing back.
				-
		-
			Chapter 60 - The Defeat
		-
			-
				Chapter 60 - The Defeat: Verse 1
			-
				-
					As the definition of insanity is to do the same thing multiple times and expect
					differing results, the child instead chose to trade their insanity for the
					opponent's psychopathy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 60 - The Defeat: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child, dodging every sloppy attempt at retaliation, struck upon every
					gap in the opponent's guard, until, as the giant collapsed from the pain, did
					the child kick the beast in the face and unto the ground.
				-
			-
				Chapter 60 - The Defeat: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the crowd watched in horror as the child wasted no time in beating down
					upon the giant's face with the sole of their foot, even as the beast pleaded
					and begged for mercy, and though the crowd stood petrified, the tyrant's
					interest was aroused.
				-
			-
				Chapter 60 - The Defeat: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now a hard heart was not natural to the child, and as the child neared a state
					of total mania did the voice call out once more, this time for the opposite
					reason, and it said unto the child "this is not who you are", so as the beast
					began to let out a pathetic whimper did the child regain their senses, and
					recall the other means by which to end the fight.
				-
			-
				Chapter 60 - The Defeat: Verse 5
			-
				-
					So the child lifted up the giant's shoulder and slung the opponent's limp body
					over their shoulder.
				-
			-
				Chapter 60 - The Defeat: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the child lumbered with the beast upon their back, and went to cast the
					disgraced fighter from the ring.
				-
			-
				Chapter 60 - The Defeat: Verse 7
			-
				-
					But that short time was enough for the opponent to recover their senses just
					enough to sling one clean hit upon the child as they were flung from the
					child's shoulder.
				-
			-
				Chapter 60 - The Defeat: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And the child hit the floor of the ring with a bruised rib as the beast hit the
					floor beside it, dazed and defeated.
				-
			-
				Chapter 60 - The Defeat: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And the child, struggling to stand with their injury, sat up, not entirely sure
					what to make of their victory, and neither was the crowd.
				-
		-
			Chapter 61 - The Victor
		-
			-
				Chapter 61 - The Victor: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as all present stood perplexed did the tyrant rise from their seat.
				-
			-
				Chapter 61 - The Victor: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And with a single bound did the tyrant leap from their booth and landed right
					before the child, startling all who beheld the superhuman feat.
				-
			-
				Chapter 61 - The Victor: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the tyrant stretched their hand unto the child, who, being injured and
					having observed the tyrant's physical prowess, knew their was nothing to be
					gained by resisting, and so the child took the tyrant's hand.
				-
			-
				Chapter 61 - The Victor: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the tyrant pulled the child up and raised their hand into a victory pose,
					and though the child was in anything but a celebratory mood, the crowd cheered,
					though that is not to say that the child's triumph did not plant a seed of
					hubris in their subconscious.
				-
			-
				Chapter 61 - The Victor: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the child was personally escorted by the tyrant and their guard unto the
					arena's exit, as the child and the tyrant's heir exchanged curious glances, and
					the child was given a prize far more massive than they had anticipated, by none
					other than the tyrant themselves.
				-
			-
				Chapter 61 - The Victor: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And as the tyrant bid the child farewell did the child, remembering their
					mission, seek to flee the moment all relavent eyes had left them.
				-
		-
			Chapter 62 - The Champion
		-
			-
				Chapter 62 - The Champion: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child sought to make their way unto the station, but in the dead of
					night was it past the hour of its service, and so the child sought to seek
					refuge in an inn.
				-
			-
				Chapter 62 - The Champion: Verse 2
			-
				-
					But word of the child's victory over the opponent had already begun spreading
					by word of mouth, like a wildfire around the city, and riots broke out among
					the people in mockery of the regime and their favored fighter.
				-
			-
				Chapter 62 - The Champion: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And as the crowds swelled in the city streets was the child caught in the tide,
					having no choice but to hide in plain sight as they made their way unto the
					city hall.
				-
			-
				Chapter 62 - The Champion: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And though the child strived to keep a low profile were they identified by a
					noble who lay beaten and bloody in the street.
				-
			-
				Chapter 62 - The Champion: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Now the protesters saw a comrade in the child who had felled the regime's
					beast, and before the child could say a word were they made the people's
					champion against their will, hoisted upon a protester's shoulder.
				-
			-
				Chapter 62 - The Champion: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now as the riots spread was the wrath of the tyrant sent in to quell the
					violence, or that is what they would claim as they fought fire with gunfire.
				-
			-
				Chapter 62 - The Champion: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And as the people rioted in the child's name did the child cry out to stand
					down, not wishing to shed anymore blood, but their voice was drowned out by the
					mob.
				-
			-
				Chapter 62 - The Champion: Verse 8
			-
				-
					So, as the wrath of the tyrant took aim did the child, thinking only of the
					imminent bloodshed, leap from the shoulder they sat upon and rushed before the
					wrath of the tyrant, claiming responsibility for the riots as they begged for
					mercy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 62 - The Champion: Verse 9
			-
				-
					BUT THE MOB, FEELING BETRAYED BY THEIR CHAMPION'S SURRENDER, RUSHED FORTH UNTO
					THE WRATH OF THE TYRANT, AND THUS WERE THE STREETS OF THE CITY PAINTED RED, AND
					THE WEEPING CHILD WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.
				-
		-
			Chapter 63 - The Jail
		-
			-
				Chapter 63 - The Jail: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child, with their prize taken from out of their hand, and having been
					cast into a stone pit, slumped defeated against the wall, awaiting their so
					called trial, where they would surely be put to death.
				-
			-
				Chapter 63 - The Jail: Verse 2
			-
				-
					But as the child gazed through the bars that held them captive and across the
					hall did they recoil in shock as they saw the opponent sitting opposite their
					cell.
				-
			-
				Chapter 63 - The Jail: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And it was at that same moment that the opponent noticed the company of the
					child, and without any hesitation lunged towards the iron pillars before them,
					denting the metal with their stirkes, and assaulting the child's ear with their
					curses, and the child responded in turn, and between the two erupted a verbal
					blight so vile that even the skin of the guards was made to crawl.
				-
			-
				Chapter 63 - The Jail: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But the opponent's cursing tirade slowed as it gave way to a weeping stammer,
					lasting several minutes before ending in what was obviously a child's nickname.
				-
			-
				Chapter 63 - The Jail: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the child, beginning to feel pity for the opponent, asked of whom the
					opponent spoke.
				-
			-
				Chapter 63 - The Jail: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And behold, the opponent revealed that they had sought to pit the child against
					them, so as to rig the match in their favor, that by virtue of their victory
					might their own child be spared the wrath of the tyrant, to whom said child was
					ensalved, though as their fight was lost, so to was hope unto their beloved.
				-
			-
				Chapter 63 - The Jail: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the child, overcome with guilt, stumbled backwards and fell upon the floor,
					left speechless by the truth of the opponent's motivations, for the giant was
					no beast at all, but they were not sure if the same could be said of
					themselves.
				-
		-
			Chapter 64 - The Sorrow
		-
			-
				Chapter 64 - The Sorrow: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now in the days that followed did the child refuse to leave their cell, even so
					as to bathe, for they knew the risk of such things for those of their sort in
					such a vile place.
				-
			-
				Chapter 64 - The Sorrow: Verse 2
			-
				-
					But as the child festered in their cell did they hear the wailing of the
					opponent from the shower stalls.
				-
			-
				Chapter 64 - The Sorrow: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child turned to see the opponent, bruised and bloody, being escorted
					unto their cell, and the guards cast the opponent roughly unto the floor as
					they shut the door.
				-
			-
				Chapter 64 - The Sorrow: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child inquired of what had transpired, though the opponent refused to
					answer.
				-
			-
				Chapter 64 - The Sorrow: Verse 5
			-
				-
					But just as the child had resolved to let the issue alone did another pair of
					inamtes walk by, talking amongst themselves, revealing in their dialogue that
					the opponent, having collapsed in the shower upon learning of the death of
					their child, had been assaulted and robbed of their dignity by a gang of
					savages in their moment of weakness.
				-
			-
				Chapter 64 - The Sorrow: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And in that moment, knowing the child had heard everything, did the opponent's
					fascade of resilience give way to their true feelings as they broke down
					completely, and the opponent looked across the hall expecting to see mockery
					upon the child's face, they instead saw pity.
				-
			-
				Chapter 64 - The Sorrow: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the wordless exchange of the opponent and the child continued well into the
					night, until both had fallen asleep.
				-
		-
			Chapter 65 - The Understanding
		-
			-
				Chapter 65 - The Understanding: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the child slept did they recall the traveler in their dream, calling out
					for them so loudly that the opponent awoke to the pitiful sight of the child
					crying in their sleep.
				-
			-
				Chapter 65 - The Understanding: Verse 2
			-
				-
					As seeing the child is such a vulnerable state were they reminded of their own
					child, and in that moment observed a sort of twisted yet poetic irony to the
					situation that they would have assumed to be contrived if they didn't know any
					better.
				-
			-
				Chapter 65 - The Understanding: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now the next morning, at the dawn of the day of the trial, was the child rudely
					awoken by a sudden strike in the head.
				-
			-
				Chapter 65 - The Understanding: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And as the child came to their senses did they see that it was a bar of soap
					they had been assaulted with, and they lood across the hall to see that it was
					the opponent who had thrown it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 65 - The Understanding: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the opponent said unto the child that the child could stand to tidy
					themselves up so as to respect the dignity of the courtroom, considering their
					odor was detectable from across the hall.
				-
			-
				Chapter 65 - The Understanding: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the child, though mildly offended, muttered a half hearted thanks in
					response.
				-
			-
				Chapter 65 - The Understanding: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the opponent turned so as to respect the child's privacy, though the other
					inmates were not so gracious, but the child was too exhausted to care either
					way.
				-
			-
				Chapter 65 - The Understanding: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And so at last did the guards come to escort the child to their mockery of a
					trial, and as the child left could they almost make out a "good luck" from the
					opponent's cell.
				-
		-
			Chapter 66 - The Trial
		-
			-
				Chapter 66 - The Trial: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the gavel struck the bevel did the trial begin with the innumerable
					charges levied against the child, who was left to represent themselves against
					a law they had sought to destroy but not to study.
				-
			-
				Chapter 66 - The Trial: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And though the child's silver tongue afforded them some agility among the
					verabl traps laid by the prosecution, they were no match against a superior
					opponent in a rigged game.
				-
			-
				Chapter 66 - The Trial: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But the child did not come so far in war to meet their end in a court, so as a
					last ditch effort did the child seek not to move the judge, but the jury.
				-
			-
				Chapter 66 - The Trial: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child lied, claiming to be of a gang that had connections among the
					prophet's army, and they defended this alibi by citing points that only one who
					indeed knew the prophet could have known.
				-
			-
				Chapter 66 - The Trial: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And unto the jury did the child say that though they had no case before their
					charges, the prophet did not know the tyrant's laws, and so if the jury was to
					save their skin before the prophet's sword, they must place their law beneath
					their foot, and nullify the verdict.
				-
			-
				Chapter 66 - The Trial: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And as the jury began to cower in fear did the prosecution stand shocked, for
					though they had rigged the game, they had, in their hypocrisy, expected a fair
					fight.
				-
			-
				Chapter 66 - The Trial: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And so that the judge would not invalidate the jury did the child make the same
					threat unto them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 66 - The Trial: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And in less than an hour of deliberation did the jury acquit the child, and so
					the child was freed before a stunned court, and had their money returned.
				-
		-
			Chapter 67 - The Bail
		-
			-
				Chapter 67 - The Bail: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now word of the child's antics had spread throughout the prison where they had
					been held, and begot unrest.
				-
			-
				Chapter 67 - The Bail: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And still traumatized by their assault did the opponent meander through the
					halls until they too heard of the child's triumph.
				-
			-
				Chapter 67 - The Bail: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And as the opponent sat in their cell that night what was to become of them at
					their trial were they informed that their bail had been paid, and that they
					were to meet their benefactor at the train station.
				-
			-
				Chapter 67 - The Bail: Verse 4
			-
				-
					So, free for the time being, did the opponent make their way to the designated
					location, only to find the child waiting for them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 67 - The Bail: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Now as the opponent went to thank the child did the child make it known that
					their generosity, which had left them broke did not come free of charge, and
					that the opponent was to, on their own dollar, conspire with the child a scheme
					to employ the local organized crime to liberate all who remained in the prison.
				-
			-
				Chapter 67 - The Bail: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the child made it known that if the opponent chose not to cooperate, then
					they would leave them to their fate upon their trial, which would certainly be
					death.
				-
			-
				Chapter 67 - The Bail: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Now the opponent was shaken by all that had happened, and though they wanted to
					get back at the regime which had taken their child did they have difficulty
					believing that a scheme that the child proposed was even remotely feasible.
				-
			-
				Chapter 67 - The Bail: Verse 8
			-
				-
					So, having no other way to establish the opponent's confidence did the child
					dispell their alias and revealed themselves as an agent of the prophet, seeking
					the prisoners, who surely hated the tyrant, as spoils in the form of soldiers.
				-
			-
				Chapter 67 - The Bail: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And the opponent understood everything.
				-
		-
			Chapter 68 - The Bargain
		-
			-
				Chapter 68 - The Bargain: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now using an old terminal in the opponent's possession did the child track the
					location of their third eye, and knowing that it was surely in the hands of the
					city's underworld did the child propose that the opponent use their influence
					among the theives to bargain for it, that the child might use it to reach out
					to the prophet.
				-
			-
				Chapter 68 - The Bargain: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the opponent went unto the location specified by the child, and exchanged
					their old trophies, now meaningless unto them, for the child's third eye,
					meaningless unto the theives as they could not crack the ciphers the child had
					placed upon it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 68 - The Bargain: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And with their third eye returned did the child once again scheme unto the
					officials of the city as they had unto the wrath of the tyrant before,
					directing the prison wardens and the local guards to lower security, an order
					that would surely arouse some suspicion, but not too much.
				-
			-
				Chapter 68 - The Bargain: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child instructed the opponent to commit a crime sufficient to be
					apprehended once again, that once returned unto the prison they might inform
					their fellow inmates of the prophet's coming, and to fight with the prophet
					when the time came, for with the opponent's knowledge of the underworld might
					their words be heeded.
				-
			-
				Chapter 68 - The Bargain: Verse 5
			-
				-
					So the opponent went before a statue of a noble and defaced it, and put up no
					resistence as the statue's likeness called for their arrest.
				-
			-
				Chapter 68 - The Bargain: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now with their scheme in motion did the child call unto the prophet.
				-
		-
			Chapter 69 - The Transmission
		-
			-
				Chapter 69 - The Transmission: Verse 1
			-
				-
					But the child was distraught to find that communication between themselves and
					the prophet had been cut off, for as they had been tardy on their return were
					they presumed dead, and anyone attempting to communicate in their name an
					imposter.
				-
			-
				Chapter 69 - The Transmission: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Yet as the child's hope was just about to give way to despair did they receive
					a transmission from an unknown source.
				-
			-
				Chapter 69 - The Transmission: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And as the voice came through did the child recognize the voice of the rival.
				-
			-
				Chapter 69 - The Transmission: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child answered the transmission, telling the rival all that had
					transpired since their parting, and of their current predictament.
				-
			-
				Chapter 69 - The Transmission: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Now the rival made it known that they had maintained contact with the leader,
					unbeknownst to the prophet, and that though the prophet had taken their army
					unto another target, the leader remained behind, along with enough troops to
					successfully execute the plan.
				-
			-
				Chapter 69 - The Transmission: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the next day did the leader join in the conversation with the child and the
					rival, and it was decided that the attack would begin at dawn, and the child
					was instructed to flee the city.
				-
			-
				Chapter 69 - The Transmission: Verse 7
			-
				-
					So that night did the child board the train for the general area among which
					lay the resistence headquarters, and, having forgotten the feeling of a good
					night's sleep in the moon they had been gone, noted the sound of the leader's
					forces heading into the city as they dozed off into pleasant dreams.
				-
		-
			Chapter 70 - The Return
		-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child returned unto the headquarters of the resistence to the embrace
					of the few who were present, and all there watched through the child's third
					eye as the battle in the prisons spilled unto the streets.
				-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And though the wrath of the tyrant would have normally crushed such a rebellion
					easily, this time they had to contend both with the forces of the resistence
					and with the local branch of every underworld mob and gang.
				-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the streets were painted red as bodies piled up, most of them civilians,
					but at the end of it did the leader emerge victorious, and the leader's silver
					tongue swayed those who remained in favor of the prophet, for it was the tyrant
					who had kept their city under their heel.
				-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And so the leader began to prepare a return unto the resistence headquarters,
					and the opponent assisted in housing the new troops among the estates of
					underworld connections provided by the freed prisoners.
				-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the prophet, having completed their own mission, heard from the leader of
					how their ranks had, in the span of their absence, increased from hundreds to
					thousands.
				-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the prophet and the leader returned together unto the resistence
					headquarters to find the child, exhausted yet triumphant, sitting together with
					the rival who had come to visit them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Now the rival had planned to depart before the prophet arrived, lest they get
					into trouble, but as the prophet seemed only interested in scolding the child
					for nearly getting themselves killed, the prophet, having heard of the nature
					of the triumph, ordered the rival to prepare for the next mission.
				-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And after a terrifying earful from the prophet was the child declared unfit for
					fieldwork in their current state, and thus instructed to devote their time to
					contriving new arms with which to arm the new troops.
				-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And before the child retired to bed that night did they receive a transmission
					from the opponent, thanking them, for everything.
				-
			-
				Chapter 70 - The Return: Verse 10
			-
				-
					Behold, the resistence was rising.
				-
		-
			Chapter 71 - The Ship
		-
			-
				Chapter 71 - The Ship: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And a sun passed as the prophet's forces grew among the shadows.
				-
			-
				Chapter 71 - The Ship: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Now the prophet knew that with an increased bodycount could they mount a proper
					assault upon the wrath of the tyrant, but they also knew that numbers alone a
					victory did not make.
				-
			-
				Chapter 71 - The Ship: Verse 3
			-
				-
					So the prophet called the leader and the rival to meet in private with the
					child, that with the child operating from behind the scenes could they thwart
					the tyrant's means of communication.
				-
			-
				Chapter 71 - The Ship: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the leader noted that the wrath of the tyrant possessed a network of
					satellites by which they managed their military transmissions, and that the
					child's arts could be used to allow for the infiltration of a shipment unto it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 71 - The Ship: Verse 5
			-
				-
					So it was agreed that the child was to remain behind and decieve the enemy from
					the shadows as the leader and the rival went, posed as astronauts, unto a
					launch scheduled within the next moon, that once in place would a key satellite
					be demolished.
				-
		-
			Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN
		-
			-
				Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the day of the mission came did the leader and the prophet arrive into
					the arms of the tyrant's wrath, cloaked in the aliases of two who had been
					killed in their place by the resistence.
				-
			-
				Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the leader and the rival joined with one among the wrath of the tyrant as
					they walked unto the launch tower.
				-
			-
				Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now the leader and the rival had met with this bright eyed youth in the time
					leading up to this day, and had, in posing as friends, learned of the youth's
					dreams of seeing the splendor of space firsthand, a dream which, despite the
					mission, the leader and the rival could empasize with.
				-
			-
				Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And, once up close to the behemoth of a ship did the three stand in awe of its
					scale, yet managed to swallow their feelings as they boarded the vessel.
				-
			-
				Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Now with the three young astronauts in their seats did the youth configure the
					rocket for launch as the leader and the rival looked upon each other for
					reassurance.
				-
			-
				Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the Earth shook as liftoff commenced, and the three were taken aback by the
					sheer force of the mighty machine.
				-
			-
				Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN: Verse 7
			-
				-
					But as the pressure eased and the vessel entered into orbit did the youth
					unstrap from their seat so as to gaze upon the Earth below, and in joining the
					youth did the leader and the rival, in the absence of the gravity of their
					world, forget the gravity of their mission as they gazed slack jawed unto the
					blue orb they called home.
				-
			-
				Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And as the rocket shot towards its destination did the three gush in childlike
					wonder over the experience, and the child thought of how marvellous it must
					have been as they awaited the return of their friends in envy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 72 - NASO ILEN: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Though as a sort of conselation, the prophet had allowed the child that day to
					conduct a test flight of a jet they had helped design, their first fieldwork
					since being confined to support, and to take with them, in the flesh of their
					arm, a more covert means of communication, an implant also devised by the
					child.
				-
		-
			Chapter 73 - The Orbit
		-
			-
				Chapter 73 - The Orbit: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And the payload of the rocket and its occupants arrived at last unto the
					satellite.
				-
			-
				Chapter 73 - The Orbit: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Now even still was the nature of the mission to be covert, that is, to plant a
					bomb upon the satellite that was to detonate at a later time, and this was a
					relief unto the rival, who had taken a liking unto the youth.
				-
			-
				Chapter 73 - The Orbit: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But as the leader went to plant the bomb, posing it as a replacement component,
					did a sudden transmission come through from the wrath of the tyrant, for they
					had, in examining the records, uncovered the infiltration, and made it known
					that the youth was to dispatch of the spys.
				-
			-
				Chapter 73 - The Orbit: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the youth was taken aback by the sudden revelation, and looked in disbelief
					unto their so called friends, and in their naivete, asked if it was true.
				-
			-
				Chapter 73 - The Orbit: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And though the youth strived to find a non violent way to resolve the
					situation, the leader wasted no time in charging them, and the rival watched on
					in horror.
				-
			-
				Chapter 73 - The Orbit: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now though the youth was weak, as they had only ever devoted themselves to
					their studies to the neglect of their body, did they manage to grab the bomb
					and dislodge it, but in doing so activated it as they were flung by their own
					kick towards the rival.
				-
			-
				Chapter 73 - The Orbit: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the youth found that the bomb stuck to their suit, and in a desperate panic
					looked unto the rival and begged for mercy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 73 - The Orbit: Verse 8
			-
				-
					But the rival, in that very same panic, kicked the youth away from them without
					even thinking, and as they froze in the immediate guilt did the leader, feeling
					the gravity of the situation in the absence of the gravity of Earth, grab the
					rival and fly back towards the vessel as the youth flew towards the satellite.
				-
			-
				Chapter 73 - The Orbit: Verse 9
			-
				-
					AND THE RIVAL LET OUT A SHRILL SCREAM AS THE VOID WAS LIT UP BY THE EXPLOSION,
					AND WEPT UNCONTROLABLY AS THE SEVERED HEAD OF THE YOUTH FLOATED RIGHT BEFORE
					THEIR EYES, LEAVING A TRAIL OF RED BEHIND IT.

				Chapter 74 - The Evactuation: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the leader and the rival, safe again in the capsule, resolved to keep the
					vessel in orbit as they contacted the prophet.
				-
			-
				Chapter 74 - The Evactuation: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And it would be safe for a time, for as the satellite had been destroyed, so to
					had the ability of the wrath of the tyrant to keep watch upon the sky, but it
					would only be a few hours before gravity would regain its hold over the ship.
				-
			-
				Chapter 74 - The Evactuation: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now though the prophet had strived to keep the child ignorant of the situation,
					the child had in fact been eavesdropping upon the transmissons through their
					third eye, and so turned their jet towards the vessel's course.
				-
			-
				Chapter 74 - The Evactuation: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now the child knew that upon landing the capsule in the waters would their
					friends require an evacutation.
				-
			-
				Chapter 74 - The Evactuation: Verse 5
			-
				-
					So the as the child tracked the ship's course did they establish communication
					with its occupants so as to guide them unto a safe landing.
				-
			-
				Chapter 74 - The Evactuation: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And so the vessel began its fiery descent, falling several miles before
					releasing its parachute.
				-
			-
				Chapter 74 - The Evactuation: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And as the vessel splashed down safely in the waters did the child descend over
					the landing point, letting down a rope unto their friends.
				-
			-
				Chapter 74 - The Evactuation: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And with all parties safely on board did the jet set off for the resistence
					headquarters.
				-
		-

			-
				Chapter 75 - The Meteor: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the child steered the jet towards the resistence headquarters did the
					rival begin to weep openly, and the leader explained unto the child what the
					rival could not find the words to, and the child took pity on the rival and on
					the youth, who in some ways seemed not too different from the traveler.
				-
			-
				Chapter 75 - The Meteor: Verse 2
			-
				-
					But the reunion was interrupted as the sky lit up despite this occuring at
					dusk.
				-
			-
				Chapter 75 - The Meteor: Verse 3
			-
				-
					NOW SUDDENLY, AND WITHOUT WARNING DID THE SKY SHAKE FROM THE FORCE OF AN
					EXPLODING METEOR, AND THE SHOCkWAVE TORE A WING FROM THE JET, AND THE THREE
					WITHIN WERE SENT HURTLING TOWARDS THE GROUND.
				-
			-
				Chapter 75 - The Meteor: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now as the leader and the rival panicked did the child seize two parachutes in
					store, and ushered the leader and the rival out with them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 75 - The Meteor: Verse 5
			-
				-
					BUT AS THE LEADER AND THE RIVAL FELL THROUGH THE AIR DID THE CHILD LOOK BACK IN
					HORROR TO FIND THAT NO PARACHUTE REMAINED FOR THEM, AND WITH NO ONE THERE TO
					DELIVER THEM DID THE CHILD PANICK AS THEY FELL TOWARDS CERTAIN DEATH.
				-
		-
			Chapter 76 - The Air
		-
			-
				Chapter 76 - The Air: Verse 1
			-
				-
					But in this moment of despair did that voice echo within the child once again,
					and it said "the way up is in this moment the way down, for you will see your
					friends, and the leader, again."
				-
			-
				Chapter 76 - The Air: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child's head cooled as their breathing slow, and, after taking a fire
					blanket from the rear of the jet, tying it to their suit, and placing their
					third eye within their pocket, did they leap into the air.
				-
			-
				Chapter 76 - The Air: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now the child had read of those who had survived such falls, and knew the best
					option was to land among a damp forrest, that the foliage might cushion the
					fall, but behold, beneath them there was only water, which is like unto
					concrete in such a scenario.
				-
			-
				Chapter 76 - The Air: Verse 4
			-
				-
					So, having made of themselves a flying squirrel did the child seek to slow
					their descent, that the waters might be like unto mud.
				-
			-
				Chapter 76 - The Air: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And as the child approached impact did they unfold the blanket and, in an
					unusual fashion for them, having founf themselves in a foxhole, did they pray
					to any higher power that might be listening.
				-
			-
				Chapter 76 - The Air: Verse 6
			-
				-
					NOW DID THE CHILD COLLIDE WITH THE WATERS, SHATTERING A RIB AND A SHIN AND
					KNOCKING THE BREATH FROM THEM, AND THE CHILD WAS SUBMERGED.
				-
			-
				Chapter 76 - The Air: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Now in great pain did the child, with their still functioning limbs, crawl back
					to the surface, only to see that the nearest land was far off.
				-
			-
				Chapter 76 - The Air: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And the child sunk into despair as they sunk into the sea, wondering what sort
					of cruel god would have preserved their life through such incredible odds only
					to watch them die like this, and the child's tears became indistinuishable from
					the waters they melted into as the child's consciousness began to wash away.

			-
				Chapter 77 - The Reciprocation: Verse 1
			-
				-
					But as the child resolved to go gently into that good night did they hear some
					sort of voice, but it was not the one they had heard before, and in fact, the
					child could not tell what it was trying to say, as if it was not even human.
				-
			-
				Chapter 77 - The Reciprocation: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Now as the child drifted off did they feel as though they were being lifted up,
					and wondered, as they approached the light, if they were entering the
					afterlife, but as they wondered if they were to meet the traveler did the voice
					that spoke unto them before spoke once more, and said "as has been said, so is
					said again, you will see your friends again."
				-
			-
				Chapter 77 - The Reciprocation: Verse 3
			-
				-
					AND ALL OF A SUDDEN DID THE CHILD'S BODY, LIFTED BY SOMETHING BENEATH, BREAK
					THROUGH THE WATERS, AND THOUGH IT HURT, THE CHILD DREW BREATH.
				-
			-
				Chapter 77 - The Reciprocation: Verse 4
			-
				-
					NOW BEHOLD, THAT OTHER VOICE THAT HAD SPOKEN TO THE SINKING CHILD HAD IN FACT
					BEEN NOT OF A HUMAN MOUTH, FOR A DOLPHIN, THE SAME THAT THE RIVAL HAD RESCUED,
					HAD RESCUED THE CHILD, HAVING KNOWN THE CHILD FROM THE RIVAL'S WORDS, BEARING
					THE CHILD'S LIMP BODY UPON THEIR PERSON.
				-
			-
				Chapter 77 - The Reciprocation: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And as the child came to their senses did they at first recoil in shock, but as
					the child looked into the animal's eyes did it look back, and without words did
					they speak.
				-
			-
				Chapter 77 - The Reciprocation: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the dolphin, knowing the child was a denizen of the land, ferried them
					towards the shore of the nearest island, and in exchange, the child told the
					animal all that had befallen them, and somehow, the animal almost seemed to
					understand, and the child, in their gratitude, rewarded the angel of the sea
					with a name.
				-
		-
			Chapter 78 - The Wreck

			-

					But halfway towards the shore did the dolphin, sensing something important
					about the location over which they passed, suddenly dove beneath the waters.
				-
			-
				Chapter 78 - The Wreck: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And though this frightend the helpless child, who began to think that they had
					made a mistake in judging the animal's intentions, they opened their eyes once
					sumberged, and they were taken aback by what lay beneath them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 78 - The Wreck: Verse 3
			-
				-
					BEHOLD, BENEATH THE CHILD AND THE DOLPHIN LAY THE RUINS OF A SPAWLING

					AGE.
				-
			-
				Chapter 78 - The Wreck: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And as the child began to lose hold of their breath did the dolphin usher them
					back unto the surface that they might draw air again, and the child, still
					shaken by what they had seen, asked the dolphin why they had shown it to them,
					but the animal knew not how to respond.
				-
		-
			Chapter 79 - The Breach
		-
			-
				Chapter 79 - The Breach: Verse 1

					BUT AS THE CHILD RESOLVED TO LAY THE ISSUE TO REST DID THEY PANIC AS SOMETHING
					APPROACHED THEM, WITH A SHARP FIN SHOWING ABOVE THE WATERS.
				-
			-
				Chapter 79 - The Breach: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the dolphin, in the same panic, called out into the waters, and the child
					clung to the angel of the sea as they braced for the worst once again.
				-
			-
				Chapter 79 - The Breach: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But as the child cowered did they feel a shockwave echo from deep blow.
				-
			-
				Chapter 79 - The Breach: Verse 4
			-
				-
					AND IN A SUDDEN AND AWE INSPIRING SIGHT WERE THE WATERS SUDDENLY BREACHED BY A
					GREAT WHALE, SOON FOLLOWED BY OTHERS, AND THE SHARKS FLED IN TERROR.
				-
			-
				Chapter 79 - The Breach: Verse 5
			-
				-
					AND THE CHILD MARVELLED AS THE WHALES DANCED AND SANG BESIDE THEM, PEERING INTO
					THE CHILD'S EYES JUST AS THE DOLPHIN DID.
				-
			-
				Chapter 79 - The Breach: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And as the child recovered their senses, having been tossed to fro in the wakes
					of the mighty beasts did they say unto the dolphin that it was lucky to have
					such incredible friends.
				-
			-
				Chapter 79 - The Breach: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the voice that had spoken unto the child spoke now once again, saying
					"behold, they have been drawn here by the same spirit that drew you here, for
					it is by that very spirit that all things strive for life."
				-
			-
				Chapter 79 - The Breach: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Now the child, not knowing what to make of those words, interpreted them in
					line with their previous analysis, and took it to mean that this had something
					to do with their lovers.
				-
			-
				Chapter 79 - The Breach: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And the whales stayed with the dolphin and the child until they were safely out
					of dangerous waters, and the child bid them farewell as they departed, and as
					the dolphin seemed to do the same did the child vow never to forget that sight,
					nor to ever underestimate the spirit of an animal.
				-
		-
			Chapter 80 - The Shore
		-
			-
				Chapter 80 - The Shore: Verse 1
			-
				-
					And as the child continued to rest upon the dophin's back did they begin to
					drift to sleep as dusk arrived, and having been entrentched in human affairs
					for so long, the child was entraced at the beauty of the natural world,
					something they had not known much of since fleeing the village.
				-
			-
				Chapter 80 - The Shore: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And with the child soundly asleep did the dolphin finally come upon a village
					situated upon the shore, and with the child still on their back did they begin
					calling out.
				-
			-
				Chapter 80 - The Shore: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And this caught the attention of the local children who alerted their parents,
					and the parents, shocked by the sight, helped the child off of the dolphin, but
					the animal, taken aback by the panic, fled as the child was lifted off of them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 80 - The Shore: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But before the dolphin was out of sight did they look back once more upon the
					child, and the child awoke for a brief moment, just long enough to express
					their gratitude, before the angel of the sea departed.
				-

			-
				Chapter 81 - The Hospitality: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now as the child had been found unconscious were they taken in on a stretcher,
					and set upon a bed of a humble hospital within the seaside village, and they
					were placed into a cast so that their injuries might heal, with their
					belongings placed into a bag beside them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 81 - The Hospitality: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child awoke hours later to find themselves surrounded by strange faces,
					and as they came to their senses did they flinch in shock, hurting themselves
					as the doctors assured them of their saftey.
				-
			-
				Chapter 81 - The Hospitality: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And as the child debated interally whether to cry or scream did the impasses
					leave them silent as the doctors inquired of their origins.
				-
			-
				Chapter 81 - The Hospitality: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now the child, knowing they could not afford to reveal their identity despite
					the benign intentions of the doctors, feigned amesia.
				-
			-
				Chapter 81 - The Hospitality: Verse 5
			-
				-
					But as amesia called for a medicine unfit for the child's actual condition did
					the child gag at having to drink the vile potion thrust upon them by their own
					deception, and they had ample time to regret their choice of words as the
					humble food given unto them made its way back up their throat.
				-
			-
				Chapter 81 - The Hospitality: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And that night, once prying eyes had left them, did they child retrieve their
					third eye from their bag did they establish contact with the leader, who was
					relieved to see alive one who they had mistakely presumed dead for the second
					time, and as the child relayed their status to the leader did the leader
					confirm their own safety in turn.
				-
			-
				Chapter 81 - The Hospitality: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the leader, in conversing with the prophet, confirmed to the child that
					they could be rescued within the next week, and that the results of the rocket
					infiltration had proven invaluable.
				-
		-
			Chapter 82 - The Capture
		-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now that night did the child dream of the traveller once again, their spirit
					revisting a memory of the traveler tending to a wound upon them placed there by
					a bully, and the child remembered their confusion at the time regarding the
					traveler's words, that in the core of every playground menace is a hurting
					child, and misery loves company.
				-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child remained in the hospital for the next week, healing at a
					remarkable rate and growing fond of many of the doctors.
				-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But suddenly, on the seventh night, the child awoke to screaming that echoed
					throughout the hall.
				-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 4
			-
				-
					BUT AS THE CHILD CLUMSLY MEADERED OVER TO THEIR DOOR SO AS TO CLOSE IT WERE THE
					HALLS SHAKEN BY A GUNSHOT, AND BEHOLD, THE WRATH OF THE TYRANT HAD TRACKED THE
					CHILD'S LOCATION, AS THE HOSPITAL WAS UNDER THEIR ADMINISTRATION.
				-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 5
			-
				-
					AND THE CHILD HEARD THE DOCTORS PLEADING FOR THEIR SAKE, IN THE NAME OF THE
					FAITH THEY SHARED WITH THE CARETAKER, AND HEARD ONE BY ONE AS THEY WERE STRUCK
					DOWN FOR THEIR DISOBEDIENCE.
				-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now the child stood petrified, unsure of what to do, but as they contemplated
					fleeing did the voice that had spoken unto them before echo within them once
					again, saying "as they have given themselves for your sake, give the same unto
					them for theirs."
				-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And though the child's cowardice held them back, it broke upon the next
					gunshot, and with tears in their eyes did the child begin limping in the
					direction of the screaming.
				-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And seeing the bloodshed did the child rush despite the pain, and collapsed
					before the wrath of the tyrant, begging them to take what they came for, that
					the doctors might be spared.
				-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 9
			-
				-
					And so the child was apprehended, and the child and the doctors who remained
					bid farewell through silent tears as the wrath of the tyrant reported the
					capture.
				-
			-
				Chapter 82 - The Capture: Verse 10
			-
				-
					BUT WITH THEIR BUSINESS FINISHED DID THE WRATH OF THE TYRANT, SO AS TO MAKE AN
					EXAMPLE OF THE PRICE OF INSUBORDINATION, PROCEED TO MASSACRE ALL WHO REMAINED
					SAVE FOR THE CHILD, WHO THEY HAD BEEN ORDERED TO APPREHEND ALIVE, AND THE CHILD
					CRIED AND SCREAMED AND CURSED TO NO AVAIL, AND WITH A BITE UPON AN OFFICER
					BEING THE LAST STRAW WERE THEY KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS.
				-
		-
			Chapter 83 - The Bondage
		-
			-
				Chapter 83 - The Bondage: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the prophet's forces were made aware by their own intelligence that the
					hospital with custody of the child had been laid to waste, and the prophet
					became paranoid, realizing that the wrath of the tyrant had wisened up to some
					of their tricks, and that the wrath of the tryant would surely extract crucial
					details from the child.
				-
			-
				Chapter 83 - The Bondage: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child was sedated and taken in the tyrant's ships unto the capital, and
					hours after their arrival would they awaken to find themselves stripped naked,
					bound and hung by their limbs, with their head shaved, and before them sat a
					figure who gave off a malicious aura, and the child asked who the figure was,
					but recieved no answer.
				-
			-
				Chapter 83 - The Bondage: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child struggled and cursed, demanding an answer that never came.
				-
			-
				Chapter 83 - The Bondage: Verse 4
			-
				-
					BUT THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, DID THE FIGURE RISE FROM THEIR SEAT AND STRIKE THE
					CHILD, AND BEFORE THE CHILD COULD PROCESS WHAT HAD HAPPENED DID THE FIGURE, THE
					PUNISHER, PROCEED TO SAVAGELY BEAT THE CHILD AND DEFILE THEIR DIGNITY, NOT EVEN
					STOPPING TO ASK FOR INFORMATION, FOR THAT WOULD SPOIL THEIR FUN.
				-
			-
				Chapter 83 - The Bondage: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And in time the child's curses and tears ran out, giving way to silence, for
					which they were also punished.
				-
		-
			Chapter 84 - The Nights
		-
			-
				Chapter 84 - The Nights: Verse 1
			-
				-
					But as the pain the punisher inflicted became too much to bear, and the child
					began to fear that they would give out and perish, the voice echoed within the
					child once more, saying "your story does not end here, for a story such as
					yours cannot end here, nay, not before it is told", and upon hearing this, the
					child had an idea.
				-
			-
				Chapter 84 - The Nights: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child cried out, making known a despair that their mission would be in
					vain, and uttered cryptic accounts of what had befallen them unto this point,
					and the punisher, intrigued, stopped for a moment, and inquired the child of
					what they spoke.
				-
			-
				Chapter 84 - The Nights: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child began to forge an abridged tale of their life, and it held the
					punisher's interest enough to stop the pain so long as it continued over the
					next few days.
				-
			-
				Chapter 84 - The Nights: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But the punisher's vice could not be held in check with mere tales alone, so
					the child began to weave music into their lyric, and though the performance was
					only passable at best in an objective sense, the punisher was amused by the
					passion behind it, and held fire for a while.
				-
			-
				Chapter 84 - The Nights: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And it was in those fleeting moments of tranquility that the child established
					communication with the prophet by way of the device in the flesh of their arm,
					incorporating the gestures of their hand into the drama.
				-
		-
			Chapter 85 - The Interrogation
		-
			-
				Chapter 85 - The Interrogation: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Yet the prophet was in no position to deliver the child, and eventually did the
					punisher grow bored with the child's stalling, but as they went to draw out
					whatever life remained in the almost dry well of their prey did a loudspeaker
					inform them that their work was complete, and thus, as they left the room,
					looking dissapointed, did another, saner figure, the inquisitor, enter in their
					place, as the child resolved to use their station to gain intel on the tyrant
					and their wrath.
				-
			-
				Chapter 85 - The Interrogation: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Now the inquisitor told the child of how, though the punisher, in their vice,
					was unfit for any other role, they were of use in their position, such that the
					inquisitor considered them a sort of perverse masterpiece of applied
					psychopathy, so it was surprising, to say the least, that the child managed to
					distract them with such an amateur act.
				-
			-
				Chapter 85 - The Interrogation: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the inquisitor took the child down, and covered their nakedness with a
					robe, though kept the child shackled so as to prevent any tricks, and the child
					was asked if they wanted anything to eat.
				-
			-
				Chapter 85 - The Interrogation: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Yet the child, seeing through the inquisitor's trick, made absurd demands for
					the finest luxuries, so as to strain the tyrant's pocket, only to not eat any
					of the food once it was brought in, despite their temptations.
				-
			-
				Chapter 85 - The Interrogation: Verse 5
			-
				-
					But the inquisitor was slow to anger, and took for themselves what the child
					had foresaken, and from their pocket drew the child's third eye, and inquired
					of it, and demanded to know the key to its cipher, threatening to bring in the
					punisher once again should the child refuse to comply.
				-
			-
				Chapter 85 - The Interrogation: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Now the child had foreseen the possibility of their third eye being
					compromised, and thus laid within it a false profile, that with a false key one
					would be granted false intelligence.
				-
			-
				Chapter 85 - The Interrogation: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Thus did the child grant the inquisitor the false key, which seemed to satisfy
					them, and the inquisitor went to leave, and the child was left alone, shackled,
					with the food just out of reach, and for several days thereafter did a guard
					return daily to feed them gruel and clean their bucket so as to keep them
					alive.
				-
		-
			Chapter 86 - The Name
		-
			-
				Chapter 86 - The Name: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now after a week had gone by did the inquisitor return once again, after the
					guard had fed the child their daily sludge, but this time demanded to know the
					child's name, and the child replied with another false alias, which, given that
					the inquisitor been informed of the child's previous use of aliases, did not
					fool them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 86 - The Name: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the inquisitor made it known that the child was not fooling anyone, so they
					took the finest food from among the table and waved it in front of the child's
					nose, promising the child better accomodations if they complied, a lie of
					course.
				-
			-
				Chapter 86 - The Name: Verse 3
			-
				-
					But without even realizing did the child begin drooling, and in their hunger
					attempted to bite at the food which the inquisitor kept just out of reach, but
					missed as the inquisitor drew it away, biting the inquisitor's hand by
					accident, for which the inquisitor struck them across the face and questioned
					if all among the resistence were cannibal savages.
				-
			-
				Chapter 86 - The Name: Verse 4
			-
				-
					So, finally, worn down and broken, did the child begin crying as they uttered
					their first name, but the inquisitor was not satisfied with that alone, and as
					they ate of the food on the table, both to satiate themselves and to mock the
					child, did they demand to know the child's family name.
				-
			-
				Chapter 86 - The Name: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And so, after a minute of silence did the child utter it, and the inquisitor
					stopped, and they choked for a moment before asking the child to repeat
					themselves, and to utter the name of their parents, and through tears did the
					child scream out their full name and made it known that they were the child of
					the traveler.
				-
			-
				Chapter 86 - The Name: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the inquisitor was taken aback, and left to inform their superiors.
				-
		-
			Chapter 87 - The Release
		-
			-
				Chapter 87 - The Release: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now, mere minutes later did several guards rush into the dungeon where the
					child was kept, and unshackled the child, and told them that they may eat of
					the food upon the table, for they were to have a personal audience with the
					tyrant themselves, and the guards were taken aback as the child, in a hunger
					driven mania, ravenously devoured everything in reach, like an animal.
				-
			-
				Chapter 87 - The Release: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the guards, growing frustrated with the disgusting display, dragged the
					child, kicking and screaming to a shower stall and demanded that they clean
					themselves before coming before the tyrant, and the child, though still hungry,
					complied, as in their state a shower was just as tempting as any food, even if
					it would not be in private.
				-
			-
				Chapter 87 - The Release: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And though the child wanted to savor the warm water were they rushed to dry
					themselves, and then cloaked in fine garments before being sheparded out of the
					prison and through an underground passage, but recoiled in horror as they heard
					the screams of other prisoners on the way as the punisher tortured them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 87 - The Release: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child was escorted through the underground passage and unto the
					surface, revealing that they stood in the interior of the capital, and the
					child stood still for a moment, in awe of its slendor, which unbeknownst to
					them was partially due to the traveler's contributions, but with a punch to the
					back were they ordered to keep moving.
				-
		-
			Chapter 88 - The Confrontation
		-
			-
				Chapter 88 - The Confrontation: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now was the child ushered into the central palace, and up the main staircase,
					and despite their hatred for the tyrant and their wrath were they awestruck by
					the grandiosity of the architectural wonder.
				-
			-
				Chapter 88 - The Confrontation: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And finally did the child come before a set of immense doors, which parted to
					as to allow them in, revealing a great dining hall, furnished as though it was
					to receive a mob of diplomats and not a single prisoner, and at the head of the
					table on the other side of the room sat the tyrant, and their heir stood behind
					them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 88 - The Confrontation: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now as the child was instructed to sit did they sit in the chair immediately
					before them, afraid to approach the tyrant, lest they be offended.
				-
			-
				Chapter 88 - The Confrontation: Verse 4
			-
				-
					But the tyrant demanded that the child be brought to sit immediately beside
					them, yet as the guards went to drag the child over did the tyrant order them
					to let the child walk, and as the tyrant themselves slid out the chair did the
					guards stand in shock, for never before had they seen such a courteous display
					from the tyrant, let alone to a prisoner.

			Chapter 89 - The Reunion
		-
			-
				Chapter 89 - The Reunion: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child took the seat offered to them, and seeing that their guest was
					uneasy did the tyrant place their hand on the child's shoulder, though feeling
					the tyrant's enormous strength first hand did little to help the child's
					concern.
				-
			-
				Chapter 89 - The Reunion: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the tyrant lifted their hand away, saying that most, feeling such force,
					take flight from their presence, but having remembered the child's face from
					the fight with the opponent, the tyrant knew to expect better from one who had
					shown to be capable of such brutality in the ring, revealing a warrior tucked
					behind a facade of sanity.
				-
			-
				Chapter 89 - The Reunion: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the tyrant paused, before continuing that though it was odd to learn of the
					child's deception, it was wonderful to have the heir of the traveler in their
					company.
				-
			-
				Chapter 89 - The Reunion: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now the child stood shocked, and asked how the tyrant knew the traveler, and
					the tyrant paused for a moment, realizing that the traveler had told the child
					nothing.
				-
			-
				Chapter 89 - The Reunion: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the traveler said that from their perspective, they were on good terms with
					the traveler, but clearly they had been mistaken, though that in no way
					diminished their gratitude for the traveler's contributions, but surely it was
					the prophet, who was trouble from the beginning, who turned the traveler's
					heart.
				-
			-
				Chapter 89 - The Reunion: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the child stood shocked, for they had never known of this connection until
					that moment.
				-
		-
			Chapter 90 - The Gesture
		-
			-
				Chapter 90 - The Gesture: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now seeing that their guest was uneasy did the tyrant offer the child child one
					of the delicasies on the table, noting how hungry the child must be after their
					treatment in the dungeon, and the tyrant lamented that they would have never
					allowed such abuse had they known of the child's identity.
				-
			-
				Chapter 90 - The Gesture: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child, after hesitating for a moment, took a bite of the gift, before
					setting it down, and the tyrant asked if it was not to the child's liking.
				-
			-
				Chapter 90 - The Gesture: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child, to the contrary, remarked on the intricate nature of what was
					seemingly an appetizer, and how each ingredient, procured from the finest
					sources, was treated with the utmost respect, reflecting a standard of culinary
					perfection entirely unknown to all but the pinnacle of the elite.
				-
			-
				Chapter 90 - The Gesture: Verse 4
			-
				-
					So, the child glared at the tyrant, and asked, if the empire can afford such
					luxury to sate its own gluttony, then why does it oppress the people, who are
					seldom lucky enough to even find scraps with which to feed themselves.
				-
			-
				Chapter 90 - The Gesture: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the tyrant paused for a moment, and the child was shocked to see a tear
					running down the tyrant's cheek, and the tyrant asked the child "do you think I
					enjoy seeing the people suffer at my hands?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 90 - The Gesture: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And so, putting on a stern expression, the tyrant agreed to tell the child
					exactly why it is that the people are made to suffer.
				-
		-
			Chapter 91 - The Reason
		-
			-
				Chapter 91 - The Reason: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the tyrant told the child that the people have long been kept ignorant of
					the history of the world, lest they seek to revert to their old ways, when
					color and creed divided mankind among itself, and when humanity fed off of the
					flesh and fruits of beasts, for it was the latter that had brought the world to
					its knees and ignited the former like a bomb.
				-
			-
				Chapter 91 - The Reason: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Now, had humanity relinquished their evil lust for the bread of death of their
					own free will, then they might have come to dwell in paradise, but as things
					were, it was not the key to salvation but the last safeguard against the abyss.
				-
			-
				Chapter 91 - The Reason: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Verily, the tyrant proclaimed, give the people one inch and they would take a
					mile, and humanity would perish, for though the state of the world was awful,
					it kept itself stable, and had done so for over one thousand suns.
				-
			-
				Chapter 91 - The Reason: Verse 4
			-
				-
					AND THE TYRANT SAID UNTO THE CHILD "EVERYTHING I DO, ALL THAT THE PEOPLE ARE
					MADE TO SUFFER THROUGH, IS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF PREVENTING THE EXTINCTION OF
					THE HUMAN RACE."
				-
		-
			Chapter 92 - The Ancestors
		-
			-
				Chapter 92 - The Ancestors: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child protested, saying that in all their years of bearing witness to
					the worst of humanity, never have they seen anything resembling that which the
					tyrant speaks of, for to eat of the flesh of beasts was absurd enough, but to
					hate another solely for their color or creed was beyond preposterous.
				-
			-
				Chapter 92 - The Ancestors: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the tyrant replied that the child was lucky to be so ignorant, for as the
					traveler was the last known descendant of their people, so too was the child,
					and of all the bigotry that had plauged mankind before the fall, there emerged
					one among them that cast a dark shadow of all others, and that was the undying
					hatred the world held for the people of the old God.
				-
			-
				Chapter 92 - The Ancestors: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And it was with the people of the old God that the other denizens of the holy
					land, from whom the tyrant descended, clashed as the temple was laid to waste
					at the climax of the great war, leaving the earth salted with a poisoned light
					drawn from the aftermath of the greatest persecution ever committed against the
					child's ancestors.
				-
			-
				Chapter 92 - The Ancestors: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the tyrant concluded by informing the child, if the previous accounts were
					not enough to make a case against human nature, that there existed a small
					number of autonomous zones who did in fact live free of the tyrant's rule, and
					who, because of that very freedom, engaged in a sort of depravity that neither
					the tyrant nor the soldiers of their wrath could stomach to discuss in detail.
				-
		-
			Chapter 93 - The Shadow
		-
			-
				Chapter 93 - The Shadow: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child still would not give, slinging libels and accusations upon the
					tyrant of depravity and complacency for being the puppet master solely
					responsible for the sorry state of the world, and the tyrant sat in silence
					until the child ran out of breath.
				-
			-
				Chapter 93 - The Shadow: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the tyrant, instead of refuting the child, acknowledged that the child was
					right on all counts, except for one, that the tyrant was in control.
				-
			-
				Chapter 93 - The Shadow: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now as the child stood perplexed did the tyrant reveal that in fact they, along
					with the heads of the governments of all the nations in the world were
					themselves puppets of a greater master, the high command as it was known unto
					them, though even they were in the dark regarding the true identity of this
					party.
				-
			-
				Chapter 93 - The Shadow: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Yet as the child stood shocked at this revelation did the tyrant reveal that
					the traveler had in fact made direct contact with high command, and that never
					before nor since had the tyrant witnessed fear in the traveler's eyes, and the
					child remembered how they too had only once seen fear in the eyes of the
					traveler, but could not remember why.
				-
		-
			Chapter 94 - KAENA REIGN
		-
			-
				Chapter 94 - KAENA REIGN: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the tyrant's heir, having held their peace until that point, glanced over
					at the child and the child, taking notice of the heir's sudden interest, asked
					the heir to confirm that the tyrant's story was a fabrication, but the tyrant
					refused to allow the heir to utter a word, and the heir lowered their head.
				-
			-
				Chapter 94 - KAENA REIGN: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And as the child stood perplexed, the tyrant lamented that they had to have
					such a weak creature as an heir, as opposed to the warrior the traveler was
					blessed with, and the child was taken aback at the blades in the tyrant's
					words.
				-
		-
			Chapter 95 - The Ransom
		-
			-
				Chapter 95 - The Ransom: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the tyrant asked the child if they would serve in their wrath, and the
					child fell silent for a moment, before saying that so long as they live, they
					would never align themselves against humanity, but if the tyrant should kill
					them, then their corpse might be of use as an ornament.
				-
			-
				Chapter 95 - The Ransom: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the tyrant slumped back, dissapointed but not surprised, and said despite
					the child's stubborness, they might still be of use.
				-
			-
				Chapter 95 - The Ransom: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the tyrant told the child that they would be held captive in the palace
					under constant surveilance, but given good accomodations, as they were to be
					held for ransom unto the prophet, and with that, the tyrant stood up, and bid
					the child farewell as they left with the heir.
				-
			-
				Chapter 95 - The Ransom: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And once the tyrant and the heir were out of earshot, the tyrant turned to the
					heir, and said that surely the child would be swayed to their side in time, at
					which point they would be of more use than the heir ever was, and might even
					take the heir's birthright for themselves, and the heir began to weep, and they
					silently cursed both the tyrant and the child.
				-
		-
			Chapter 96 - The Ore
		-
			-
				Chapter 96 - The Ore: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now upon the very same day that the tyrant spoke with the child did the scouts
					of the tyrant's wrath make their way unto the crater left by the celestial
					bullet that had struck the child from the sky.
				-
			-
				Chapter 96 - The Ore: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And it was seen that buried deep in the pit of the stone was a resevoir of
					glowing metal, not seen upon the face of the Earth since the dawn of that
					millenium.
				-
			-
				Chapter 96 - The Ore: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And this was made known unto the tyrant, who gave the green light to begin
					preparations for a grand endeavor, that their reign might be cemented forever
					under the dark shadow of the atom's light.
				-
		-
			Chapter 97 - The Filth
		-
			-
				Chapter 97 - The Filth: Verse 1
			-
				-
					Now the child, bound up in the tyrant's dungeon once again, stripped of the
					robes and denied the food the tyrant had granted them in hopes of swaying their
					sympathy, festered in pain and filth on the stone floor, and drew unwanted
					attention from their fellow prisoners, angered at the fact that the child had
					been granted a favor by the tyrant and had the nerve to forsake it.
				-
			-
				Chapter 97 - The Filth: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And one particularly savage inmate made a brutal attempt at assault upon the
					child, as if to maul them like an animal.
				-
			-
				Chapter 97 - The Filth: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Now one prisoner came to the child's defense, at the expense of their life,
					being mortally wounded in the process, but as the prisoner lay there dying did
					the child recognize them, for they had served in the army of the prophet after
					being freed by the child and the opponent.
				-
			-
				Chapter 97 - The Filth: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the prisoner confessed unto the child that they sacrificed themselves not
					out of some perverse sense of chivalry, or even out of gratitude, but to atone
					for their error, for in having been captured were they tortured, and it was
					their torture that led to the compromise of the mission to destroy the
					satellite, and by extension were they responsible for the child's capture.
				-
			-
				Chapter 97 - The Filth: Verse 5
			-
				-
					But despite everything, the child comforted the prisoner as they passed,
					assuring them that they would be avenged by the child's hand, and asked them to
					watch from heaven when they mounted the tyrant's head on a pike.
				-
			-
				Chapter 97 - The Filth: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And over the course of the next moon in the depths of the dungeon did the child
					continue to relay all that they heard unto the prophet and the leader.
				-
			-
				Chapter 97 - The Filth: Verse 7
			-
				-
					But to the shock of the child did the prophet insist that the fact of high
					command's existence was irrelevant, and that the tyrant remained the cheif
					target of the resistance.

				-
					Now, alone once more did the child begin to ascend the mountain in pursuit of
					the truth.
				-
			-
				Chapter 100 - The Mountain: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child came upon a hidden village of those exiled by the tyrant.
				-
			-
				Chapter 100 - The Mountain: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Alas, though they had suffered before the tyrant as the child had, the child
					became wrathful at their iniquity, for they dined on blood, and the child
					terrorized them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 100 - The Mountain: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Yet further towards the summit did the child themselves weaken in
					righteousness, AND TASTED MALICE IN THE BLOOD OF THE KIND CREATURE.
				-
			-
				Chapter 100 - The Mountain: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Now did the child weaken in body, and became unfair to look upon, for in the
					blood of the kind creature did come a violent curse.
				-
			-

					And the child covered the ugliness upon their face with a stray cloth.

			-

			-
				-
					And in despair did the child draw upon the book of the old God for console, and
					projected unto it to have dialogue with the old God, and for a moment between
					time and space, the child was the child of man.
				-
			-
				Chapter 101 - The Child of Man: Verse 2
			-
				-
					And the child of sin tempted the child of God, but the child of God was
					steadfast in their ways, and the child of man came before them.
				-
			-
				Chapter 101 - The Child of Man: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child of man said unto the child of God and the child of Sin: "Who
					among you shall save everyone?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 101 - The Child of Man: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now did the child of Sin lie, and did the child of God tell the truth.
				-
			-
				Chapter 101 - The Child of Man: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the child of Sin said: "No one, that shall not be done."
				-
			-
				Chapter 101 - The Child of Man: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the child of God said "Not I, for man's sin is his own to bear save for the
					grace of God, and God does not save all."
				-
			-
				Chapter 101 - The Child of Man: Verse 7
			-
				-
					AND IN RAGE DID THE CHILD OF MAN CURSE THE CHILD OF SIN AND THE CHILD OF GOD TO
					DWELL TOGETHER IN THE INFERNO THEY BEGOT, AND CAST THE BOOK OF THE OLD GOD FROM
					THE SUMMIT.

					Behold, upon the summit of the mountain sat the image of a great and terrible

				-
			-
				Chapter 102 - The Dragon: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Behold, said the child, that surely the dragon was the monster of which the
					prophet had spoken.
				-
			-
				Chapter 102 - The Dragon: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Behold, by the cry of the tempest did the graven image come to life.
				-
			-
				Chapter 102 - The Dragon: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Behold, on the smallest head of the dragon were blank eyes, and on the medium
					head of dragon were eyes that wept blood, and on the largest head of the dragon
					were no eyes at all, and behold, the dragon was and was to remain one of a
					kind.
				-
			-
				Chapter 102 - The Dragon: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Behold, embedded in the breast of the dragon was the essence of that weapon.
				-
			-
				Chapter 102 - The Dragon: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Behold, the dragon descended to slay the child, and the mountain shook.
				-
			-
				Chapter 102 - The Dragon: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Behold, the child cheated the dragon's wrath, and in cunning did bring about

				-
			-
				Chapter 102 - The Dragon: Verse 8
			-

					NOW THE DRAGON BECAME AS A GREAT FLOOD IN DEATH, POURING OUT IN EVERY

			-
				-
					And the child found a great tree within the ruins.
				-
			-
				Chapter 103 - The Ruins: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child found the new body in the canopy of the great tree.
				-
			-
				Chapter 103 - The Ruins: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child knew Meta, and knew that weapon was of Meta, and through Meta
					knew the means of realizing the new body, thus did they leave their legacy.
				-
			-
				Chapter 103 - The Ruins: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And thus, in three days and three nights, was the great tree to bear fruit, a
					mechanical mind, to which time and space were of no consequence.
				-
			-
				Chapter 103 - The Ruins: Verse 6

					And thus was the will of the ark vested in the new body, and thus was the will

				-
			-
				Chapter 104 - The Betrayal: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Yet the leader was distant, and led the child to a ledge upon the summit, and
					inquired upon the child of the beauty of the Earth.
				-
			-
				Chapter 104 - The Betrayal: Verse 3
			-
				-
					And the child saw the colors through of the sunset, and was enamored with their
					beauty.
				-
			-
				Chapter 104 - The Betrayal: Verse 4
			-
				-
					Now the leader had conspired with the tyrant to put the child to death.
				-
			-
				Chapter 104 - The Betrayal: Verse 5
			-
				-
					Thus the leader did draw their weapon a took aim upon the child, but could not
					fire.
				-
			-
				Chapter 104 - The Betrayal: Verse 6
			-
				-
					And the child turned to see the leader, and recoiled in horror at the
					revelation of betrayal, and in great sorrow did they attempt to flee.
				-
			-
				Chapter 104 - The Betrayal: Verse 7
			-
				-
					Now did the inner order come against the child.
				-
			-
				Chapter 104 - The Betrayal: Verse 8
			-
				-
					And the child knew that no party should leave the summit but by a road of
					blood.
				-
			-
				Chapter 104 - The Betrayal: Verse 9
			-
				-
					But the child remembered that which they had seen in the canopy of the great

				-
			-

			-
				-
					And the leader cornered the child.
				-
			-
				Chapter 104 - The Betrayal: Verse 11
			-
				-
					Yet did the child strike the leader blind with a brilliant flash, and cast the

				-
			-

			-
				-
					And the looked upon their former friends, and hung their head in shame for what

				-
			-

			-
				-
					AND THE CHILD RAISED THAT WEAPON'S GAZE UNTO THE HEAVENS, AND LET FORTH THE

			-
				-
					And the child stood alone.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 2
			-
				-
					Yet the child came to see that in the violence did the door unto the ark, and
					thus unto hope, had sealed.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 3
			-
				-
					Thus the child came unto the crevice and unto the leader.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 4
			-
				-
					And the child said unto the leader: "O why have you done this wicked thing,
					that you have forged a pillar from my corpse upon which to crucify the whole of
					the Earth?".
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 5
			-
				-
					And the leader revealed unto the child that they had conspired with the tyrant
					for the sake of their own child, born of a strange lover.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 6
			-
				-
					Thus the child paused, for they forgot themselves in their anguish, and they
					said unto the leader: "now, I may be wrong in feeling as though you have
					committed adultery before me, but is this not treason?"
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 7
			-
				-
					And the child removed the cloth that had covered their face, and the leader
					recoiled in horror upon seeing what the curse of the kind creature had done
					upon the child's face.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 8
			-
				-
					Behold, the child's lips had shriveled, and their jowls drooped well past their
					years, and their eye sockets sagged deep, and their nose bled, and their hair
					receded and grayed, and their skin had an unnatural tone, and boils were upon
					their face, and thick hairs sprouted from their sores, and whatever teeth
					remained were yellow and loose, and a foul stench came forth from that same
					mouth that had consumed the kind creature, for indeed, this is how this world
					dealt with the so called hero who abandoned the holy creed.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 9
			-
				-
					Now in this moment of mutual tragedy and before the shock of the leader did the
					child speak of fond memories, unto each one of the inner order did they recount
					the gardens that had preceded these fires.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 10
			-
				-
					And the child, unable to repress their love for the leader in spite of their
					betrayal asked of them: "Must love be mutual?", to which the leader stood
					perplexed before recoiling in horror at the carnal fire in the child's sunken
					eyes.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 11
			-
				-
					AND IN UNADULTERATED AGONY DID THE CHILD GO IN UNTO THE LEADER, AND DID FORCE
					THEIR UNREQUITED LOVE UPON AND THROUGH THEM AND THEIR ROBES AND THEIR PROTESTS,
					AND LOINS WERE UPON LOINS, AND THE CHILD CRIED TEARS OF PLEASURE AND OF PAIN,
					OF PASSION AND OF GUILT, AND THE LEADER FELL SILENT, AND BEHOLD, ALL PARTIES
					LAY UPON ROCK BOTTOM IN THE EMBRACE OF THE CREVICE.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 12
			-
				-
					And the child, knowing their sin, collapsed before the leader, and laid down
					beside them, and pleaded in vain for them to stay, saying "O my friend, do not
					leave me, but stay now, for I cannot bear to be alone any longer", and the
					child wept themselves into a deep slumber.
				-
			-
				Chapter 105 - The Agony: Verse 13
			-
				-
					And the leader, in fading consciousness and with a silent requiem, said in
					spirit unto the child "perhaps you could not have forseen my betrayal, but I
					could never have fathomed that you would meet your end this pathetically, and
					alas I must admit defeat before the law, that the strong eat the weak, for you
					have consumed me indeed, so if there be a hell greater than this, perhaps you
					shall not be so alone after all and, neither shall I", and the leader perished
					in their sleep, and their years numbered thirty and three suns.
